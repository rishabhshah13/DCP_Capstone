Helps millions of people stay healthy. Saves the country billions of dollars.  The NCQA seal is a widely recognized symbol of quality. Organizations incorporating the seal into advertising and marketing materials must first pass a rigorous, comprehensive review and must annually report on their performance.   NCQA’s programs and services reflect a straightforward formula for improvement: Measure. Analyze. Improve. Repeat. NCQA makes this process possible in health care by developing quality standards and performance measures for a broad range of health care entities.   NCQA’s contribution to the health care system is measured through statistics that track the quality of care delivered by the nation’s health plans. Every year for the past five years, these numbers have improved; health care protocols have been refined, doctors have learned new ways to practice, and patients have become more engaged in their care. Those improvements in quality care translate into lives saved, illnesses avoided and costs reduced.   NCQA consistently raises the bar. Accredited health plans today face a rigorous set of standards and must report on their performance in more than 40 areas in order to earn NCQA’s seal of approval.

I have experience in and exposure to many industries, but most of my career has been spent in renewable energy, life sciences, and healthcare.  As a project manager (PMP), engineer (EIT), economist, and a marketer, I have multiple lenses through which I view systems and enjoy working to create structural order out of disarray and to connect systems and items of value with their beneficiaries. Through the course of my career, what I have found most fulfilling and, frankly, what I'm best at,  is serving businesses that are improving society by leading them to grow in a way that allows them to succeed by amplifying the good that they do.   During the pandemic, I pivoted my career and dove headfirst into the effort to prevent and fight COVID by developing operating models to get people tested where it was needed most; by establishing a statewide testing program for students, faculty, and teachers; by building an international team of 40 trained telemedicine officers working around the clock; and by establishing much needed lab capacity in Los Angeles for 4,200 PCR tests per day. It helped me find my calling. I saw how incredibly hard-working and often underappreciated our healthcare providers and practitioners are and how much we all rely on them to have a happy, healthy, and harmonious society.

Yes, occasionally, it requires some technical expertise. But what I’ve found binds successful practitioners in the space are three key traits:  - Passion for the work; - Fairness and equity at the fore; - Community voice as the anchor.  I’m no expert in any of this stuff.  But I try, and I try real hard to listen to, and learn, from others who are experts in this stuff.  By doing so - in close collaboration with team members and partners - I believe that we’ve accomplished some good: launched several multi-million dollar poverty-fighting campaigns; incubated technology solutions designed to improve the lives of low-income families; scaled initiatives for greater impact. And no matter the effort - whether it’s providing meaningful pathways into high-demand jobs for those on the downward slope of the K-shaped Covid economy; or ensuring equitable distribution and digital binding for Covid vaccinations in the Global South; or offering alternative financing mechanisms for low-income college students (some of the issues I work on) - doing so with fairness, equity, and community voice as the pillar is paramount, and in my experience produces the best results!  So this has been my life in the social sector.  Earlier in my career, I was a lawyer. I then founded and led an Internet-based educational software company in the U.S. to a successful exit.  I subsequently worked at Bain & Company as an Associate Partner, before shifting to the social sector. First at the Robin Hood Foundation, New York City's largest private foundation.  And now at SkillUp Coalition, helping individuals secure high opportunity employment.  I'm a Mentor at Techstars supporting early stage startups. I'm a board member at Upsolve, a nonprofit that helps families overcome their debt and rebuild their financial situation. I am also a board member at NYN Media, supporting efforts for NYN Media to be the go-to source for news and analysis about the New York nonprofit sector. I am also a member of the Advisory Council at FinTech4Good and an Advisory Committee Member at the United Way of Greater Philadelphia.

Over the years, various leaders have given me amazing opportunities, always with encouragement and support--two key leadership traits I continue to emulate--at times letting me learn as much from my failures as my achievements.

Key features of PSO include:  •	Integrated “multi-cycle” representation of decision processes used in the control room; •	Ability to optimize and simulate “recourse” and “non-recourse” decisions at each decision point in each cycle; •	Quantitative assessment of impacts that imperfect forecasts have on operator decisions and the deployment of reliability services; •	Efficient management of large amounts of forecast data, automatically matching each forecast to decision, allowing users to quickly assess the value of increased flexibility and improved forecasts.  •	Generalized reserve models that support new ancillary-service definitions. •	Transparent and computationally efficient simulation that can be used to “play out” operational results from deployment of reserves to meet system variability and uncertainty.

We create threat vectors that are true-to-life, are able to think as the enemy thinks, and find potential threats and exploits before the bad guys do.   What does BuddoBot mean?  Buddo – A derivative of buddy. Bot – A representation of technical efficiency and accuracy.  Combine the two and you have BuddoBot (pronounced Bud-o-Bot).

I was raised by a strong single mother who taught me the value of hard work and resilience.   After high school, I attended a local college and began to realize the importance of education.  With awesome motivation from my professors, I excelled and moved to Los Angeles to attend Loyola Law School. I became a lawyer, got married, and had two amazing children.   𝐅𝐑𝐎𝐌 𝐋𝐀𝐖 𝐓𝐎 𝐒𝐎𝐂𝐈𝐀𝐋 𝐈𝐌𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐓 🌎  As a street lawyer, I helped people on Skid Row gain access to the assistance they needed, providing pro bono social and legal services.  Serving my community was very fulfilling and impactful so I decided to take it up a notch. I earned a Master’s Degree in Public Policy from Duke University and shifted my career from law to social impact.  Since then, I’ve spent the past three decades leading teams and organizations in collaborative efforts to improve the lives of people who are struggling.  I’ve created homes for thousands of housing-insecure people, raised over $300M in funding and donations, and led 25 affordable housing real estate projects/transactions of all sizes and funding types including state, federal, and private.   𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐃𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐓𝐄𝐀𝐌𝐒 - 𝐄𝐒𝐆 | 𝐃𝐄𝐈 😀  As a leader, I am at my best putting out fires and motivating people to achieve collective goals.  I’ve also spearheaded diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts while communicating performance, financial information, and social impact achievements to a broad set of stakeholders.    My happiest professional moments have been mentoring my team members to grow in their careers and seeing them go on to major leadership roles.  As a compassionate leader, I live by the Ralph Waldo Emerson quote: “...to find the best in others…This is to have succeeded.”  𝐋𝐄𝐓'𝐒 𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐂𝐓 𝐎𝐍 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐄𝐃𝐈𝐍 👉🏼  Outside of work, I like to spend time with my family, whether that’s at home cooking and gardening or traveling on adventures, like mountain climbing, skiing, fishing and biking.  If you’re looking to chat with a passionate and people-focused leader who bridges the gaps between social impact strategy, stakeholder collaboration, and execution, then we should definitely connect on LinkedIn.

Currently serving as the COO at Evozyne, I steer technical operations across the product portfolio, guiding therapeutic programs in gene editing & immunology from early discovery to IND. My role extends to shaping the company's strategy, leveraging a profound understanding of biotech, generative AI, and the organization's core capabilities.  As one of the early members of Evozyne, I have played a pivotal role in its growth, leading activities across fundraising (series A and B), strategy, product management, recruiting, financial planning, and budgeting. My diverse skill set was honed during my tenure as an engagement manager at McKinsey & Company, where I gained strategic experience in science & technology, medical devices, and advanced industries, coupled with expertise in R&D, procurement, and operating model transformations.  My technical foundation, rooted in my work at GE Healthcare and my PhD from Duke University, further enhances my capabilities. At GE, I focused on designing circuits and optimizing software for medical imaging systems, while my doctoral research at Duke involved groundbreaking work at the intersection of nanoscience, biotechnology, and electrical engineering. I demonstrated the first transistor-like logic device based on photons, employing DNA and organic molecules, and gained valuable stochastic simulation skills for modeling complex molecular interactions.

My balanced approach to arts and education nurtures and fosters corporate cultures representative of the communities they serve by overcoming cultural biases, socio-economic challenges, and obstacles that prevent people from expressing themselves through the arts.  I have a passion for arts and education and a reputation for growing earned and unearned income at companies I have led.  At The Cleveland Opera, I charted a clear path for a safe return to the stage in the aftermath of COVID-19 restrictions and proposed increased civic participation through educational initiatives and collaborations with organizations including Karamu House, the nation's oldest producing African American theatre.  At Charlottesville Opera, I mounted a successful 2020 summer festival and introduced the company's first small production in an alternative venue. Individual contributed income grew by 35%.  In Amarillo, I worked with over 150 educational and social service organizations to strengthen the region's cultural fabric by making arts participation and attendance free for thousands of individuals that would have otherwise not had access to the arts. The season grew from four to seven productions—and four to twenty-three performances. Contributed annual income grew 111% to more than $1M. I produced nine LatinX, six African-American, two Native American-themed productions, and an acclaimed production of Brundibar. I was the company's executive producer and on-air host of a collaboration that aired annual productions on PBS.  Previously, I served as Director of Development at the Wisconsin Historical Foundation, where I helped plan and execute a successful $77M capital campaign and secured funding for the Historical Society's $20M annual budget. I also served as CEO of Opera for the Young, and Triangle Opera in North Carolina and on the faculty of Amarillo College.

My income planning practice specializes in a process called “Red Light on the Dashboard,” which measures longevity as a baseline of retirement income duration.  Longevity is causally related to wealth in retirement. Then the process focuses on tax efficiency, keeping in mind that all income is not taxed the same way, nor is everyone’s definition of a comfortable retirement. Red Light on the Dashboard creates a custom blueprint for retirement unique to each client.   The firm works with individuals and business executives close to retirement, retirees who are dissatisfied with their results. The firm also works with people for whatever reason have taken early retirement.  We have a specialty in working with widows.    My “Red Light on the Dashboard”  process will create a custom blueprint to fit each unique person. No two plans are alike.   Some of the tools used include: Social Security claiming strategies, pensions, IRAs,  401ks, Roth’, insurance, and other assets including brokerage accounts to meet retirement goals in the most tax-efficient manner possible.   Some of the components of  “Red Light on the Dashboard” process may include:  ✔️Longevity planning   ✔️Cash flow planning and budget modeling ✔️Income planning to leverage your retirement income sources based on their tax location, to  maximize retirement portfolio assets  ✔️Stress testing by scenario, , Monte Carlo simulation of  income and investment alternatives, tax modeling using high-quality risk mitigation software  ✔️Social Security timing analysis to provide alternate claiming strategies  ✔️Strategic tax planning to pay taxes at the lowest effective marginal rate  ✔️Determine each persons’ “risk premium” and Behavioral analysis related to investing and risk tolerance, risk capacity, and risk composure.   As an independent income planner, I provide objective, fiduciary-compliant advice so you can make informed decisions in your best interest. My “Red Light on the Dashboard” process is far more powerful than the traditional “second opinion.”  If you’re interested in learning more about securing the cash flow you’ll need to live a retirement you’ll love, see how the “Red Light on the Dashboard”  process will create your worry-free retirement unique to you. https://moneymattersusa.net/red-light  Call 908-791-3831 or 1-800-593-8188.

Filling a void in the market for a versatile and stylish water shoe, Fitzgerald created one that she, her friends, and other chic travelers would love to wear. Utilizing her expertise in luxury branding, Fitzgerald’s goal was to create the ultimate resort and summer water sport shoe and lifestyle brand for men, women, and children.  Fitzgerald’s background in luxury goods marketing taught her the importance of a quality product and simplicity of design. After graduating from Duke University and moving to New York City, Fitzgerald joined Hermès and worked as a PR executive for many years, overseeing press relations and the opening of several freestanding stores. After taking time to raise a family, she and her husband founded Greyledge Farm in Litchfield County, CT. Specializing in all-natural, pasture-raised beef, pork, and poultry, the farm served restaurants, specialty shops and individual customers throughout the tri-state area. Though the brands were very different, in both roles she understood the customer wanted a product that is classic, high quality, and beautifully functional.  With an affinity for warm-weather climates, the Fitzgerald family often vacationed at destinations where the beaches were rocky and full of coral. It was here Fitzgerald discovered a white space in the market for a quality, functional water shoe that was attractive enough to also wear to lunch, around town, and boating. At the time, the only water shoe option was the poorly-constructed black mesh variety. Tired of her three teenage sons’ disapproving looks when she wore these “ugly” water shoes, Fitzgerald researched fashionable alternatives and found there were none.  Re-imagining the timeless espadrille design with a quick-drying neoprene upper and non-skid, non-marking deck shoe sole, Fitzgerald developed the Beachcomber Espadrille. Launching Sea Star Beachwear, she returned to the workforce as an entrepreneur, successfully combining her passion for creating and marketing beautiful, quality products and her love of traveling. To date, the company has sold over 100,000 pairs of espadrilles.

Next Level Holdings has launched the world’s first and only (non-annuity) guaranteed high yield fixed income product with full insurance protection.   Their Flagship Investment Product is called the NLH Principal & Interest Protected Note™ and is issued with Full Insurance Protection. It is very similar to an annuity in that you receive the same guarantees from an insurance company but without the high fees and low yields. Their unique investment offers a 24% APY which is guaranteed and is a yield that is 4-5 times higher than any annuity and with the same insurance guarantees.  The Next Level Holdings investment directive is to consistently generate a steady stream of guaranteed double digit returns for our investors, with full insurance protection and zero correlation to the equity and fixed income markets. In essence, the Next Level investment approach is to achieve historic equity-like returns with bond-like risk, or less.  Capital preservation has been established as our utmost priority. While we aggressively maintain the highest margins and deliver the highest returns to our partners, shareholders and investors, we are constantly contributing to the development of the country’s precious metals mining, timber, and agricultural chain.

The Principal & Interest Protected Note™ with Full Insurance Protection is a fixed income product which he engineered and trademarked and has since become a quintessential example within the alternative investment space of what is possible when you can marry Insurance policies for investors participating in an investment offering based on an extremely low risk/high yield arbitrage trading business.

I remember giggling while working on a needs assessment – a message that I was meant to do this.  I love learning. I find innovative ways to help people do things better. I have a knack for spotting the desire and potential to improve performance and creating efficient ways to build skills and habits that lead to results. I like pairing theory and practicality to design effective and engaging learning experiences.  In my career, I’ve applied my love of learning to coaching leaders, accelerating organizational change, and building high performing teams – often through digital learning. I enjoy the challenge of new industries so I can discover techniques that work everywhere. •	Digital learning – I started with flip phone videos to help employees make label changes easier. This grew to personalized learning experience platforms, virtual facilitation, social learning, xAPI learning analytics, and content development in eLearning, video, simulation, and all the fun formats. •	Coaching leaders – I’ve developed coaching skills through a Master’s in organizational psychology, courses on positive psychology and appreciative inquiry, and the full curriculum from the Co-Active Training Institute. Nothing thrills me more than supporting people as they learn the craft of leadership.  •	Accelerating organizational change – I have experience leading large transformational change efforts – mixing new technology with behavior change. After years of studying change, I’ve found ways to weave the people side of change into projects. The outcomes have been higher engagement, faster change, and better results. •	Building high performing teams – Working with a diverse group of people is where the magic happens. I know my strengths (and where I’m less good) and look for complementary all-stars to do great work together. My point of view on teams has evolved, but elements I learned as a platoon leader in the U.S. Cavalry still resonate – leader as servant, aligned ambition, and mutual respect.  Outside of work, I learn from my three wonderful daughters, get outside to stay centered, and run often. I am enjoying watching my two oldest daughters run XC without being too involved.

At Bose, I helped lead the transformation of the company, creating new technologies and businesses, expanding the brand, and delivering more value to customers. I am proud that my time at Bose culminated in being named only the third CEO in the company’s history.   As CEO, I was integral to reshaping virtually every facet of the company that created the customer experience — including strategy, technology, product, marketing, and sales. My mission was to build future-looking organizational capabilities to increase business value.   But transforming a company isn’t a one-person show. Everything I’ve accomplished in my career was because of great teams focused on the right vision. From transforming research and brand, to charting a new course in connected products and healthcare devices, to building digital ecosystems in the US and China, to initiating sustainability and diversity and inclusion, the results I’ve delivered are because of the teams I’ve led.   I’ve engaged effectively with a wide range of technologies, industries, and geographies — and people. Whether a new hire, a seasoned executive, an expert in marketing or a Ph.D. in data science, a Boston native or a Shanghainese. I’ve engaged and inspired. I love to energize people and feel their energy in return.  The world is going to continue to change. Consistent with my entire career, I’m going to operate at the leading edge of technology and change. And it will continue to be my privilege to lead the team that delivers the future.",no,2,no,,3,,3,1,2024,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQGCHtffGFHjsA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1598967885369?e=1715212800&v=beta&t=w0AnKixSmVry9myLoDlX_DiJ_ApyVVr5gwD1RV3AcC4,Norway,NO,,Oslo,Europe/Oslo,2,,0

The software automatically recognizes the imaging study and transfers these images to a cloud, where consultants can review a image file and even share them with their colleagues. Unlike other programs, Vigilant does not compress the file size, allowing consulting physicians to view exactly the same data, and even download the study to their own workstation and PACS.

As CEO of a multidisciplinary clinic, my skills in many areas grew– strategy, business development, marketing, HR, leadership, customer experience, and more. After building a successful business, I pivoted to a new challenge.  🩺I shifted to program development of non-mainstream medicine services in a mainstream academic medical center.  Due to my success, I was promoted to oversee System Integrative Health, followed by additional system responsibilities and subsequently, additional pediatric programming.  📖As a leader in the field and a graduate of Duke University’s Leadership in Integrative Healthcare Program, I was recruited to create and develop an Integrative Care Master’s Program for a University.  With my passion to educate and train the next generation of leaders, the curriculum was developed and underwent accreditation. I continue to teach as an Adjunct Professor for the program.   🫶I am grateful for all I have learned through these experiences and the people I have met along this journey.  However, I now find myself at the next phase of my career, ready to pivot again, but this time with more experience and skills in my toolbox. Yet, still rooted in hard work ethic, passion to better the lives of those I serve.  🦄 A recruiter I met recently called me an “innovative unicorn” who will disrupt the market of healthcare or whatever industry I choose to pivot to next.

Philosophy:  There are many reasons to invest: personal goals, preservation of capital, retirement income, preserving a legacy, providing capital for charitable causes, etc. - At CORDA, our contrarian ‘value’ driven investment strategy is focused, thoughtful and smartly conceived. We seek to own businesses that have solid balance sheets, income statements, and exceptional dividend trajectories.  If and when these opportunities are attractively priced, we will invest for the long haul.  Importantly, we are not restricted by unnecessary parameters.  Typically we will avoid the momentum of the herd and invest in what we believe are good companies that have fallen out of favor with Wall Street and the public.  We do not attempt to determine short-term price fluctuations but are instead looking for long-term value via attractive and sustainable dividends and earnings growth.

We have had great growth in my time at TBJ — among the best in the American City Business Journals family of 44 business publications. In seven years, we have more than doubled circulation, thanks to a relentless focus on news of high importance to our audience.

Previously, I worked at The News & Observer for 24 years, at WRAL-TV for nearly three and managed the website for WNCN in Raleigh, the NBC affiliate in the market.   In November 2014, WNCN.com was named the top television website in the Carolinas by the news directors association. In my five years there, we went from 500,000 page views a month to 5 million, which had a significant impact on revenue.  I also created a mobile committee at WNCN to get fresh ideas on how to improve there.  It is amazing how the news business has changed in just a few years. That has led to a real clutter of information, but also real opportunities. People will find good information on the web, and they will return for more if the quality remains high.  This time of shifting patterns of consumption means it is more important than ever to be smart about your approach and give consumers information they want. Consumers are establishing new habits and behaviors every day, and smart companies are establishing beachheads now that will lead to further success.  I especially enjoy working with young people with a passion for journalism. I have hired our interns at TBJ and started an intern program at WNCN.

She was the lead author of PREGNANT AND PARENTING STUDENT-ATHLETES; RESOURCES AND MODEL POLICIES, published by the NCAA.

We, Channel Source, have the answers. We provide data, images and solutions that can be used to capture the incremental value, and the consumer engagement to make your brand stand out at retail. We work with store associates to provide real results and accountability for your brand.  This is important given that:  📌	81% of consumers will change shopping decisions if items are out of stock.  📌	63% of cosmetic departments do not have a dedicated manager to support brand integrity.  📌	80% of consumer retail purchases are made at the shelf. Being in stock is critical.  Now is more important than ever to have in-store representation with your retail partners. This is because every department manager in the store has expanded responsibilities due to Covid-19. These are not only overwhelming but are leading to inventory integrity being delayed from daily or weekly to now only monthly activities.   The services we offer can really make an impact. We can help with:   ✔	Store Service Elements (correcting out of stock items, adjusting inventory counts, etc.) ✔	Secondary In-Store Product Placement ✔	Product Resets & Updates ✔	In-Store Pop-Up Events (all within the new COVID rules and regulations) ✔	Custom Store Merchandising Plans ✔	Sales Reports & so much more! ✔	Point of Sale Marketing Materials  In the HBC category, She makes her initial decision using various criteria.

Urban populations are growing because cities increasingly have a lot to offer. But as cities mature and buildings are re-purposed, the line between residential and commercial zones is blurred. As a result, light pollution from LED-based digital signs takes a toll on the quality of life of nearby urban residents; not everyone wants to live in Las Vegas or Times Square.  This sentiment has led some cities, such as Denver and L.A., to strictly regulate or entirely ban LED displays.  However, cities need digital signs as they have been proven to be an effective communication tool.  Businesses and brands need diverse channels to communicate with consumers, and city governments need to inform residents.   At Solchroma, we think digital signage can be beautiful.  We believe urban residents can live in harmony with local businesses and corporate brands: Solchroma is building a light pollution-free outdoor digital display for the smart cities of the future that enables digital communication with a printed look.

We do one thing - represent employers in labor and employment matters.

Although skilled and tenacious advocates, our attorneys recognize that the most aggressive and expensive approach may not always be the best solution to a client's problem. We seek to identify the client's primary business objective, design a solution to fit the objective, and implement that solution in the most efficient manner possible.   By performing compliance audits, providing the right policies, procedures and training, and offering thoughtful advice and counsel, we assist clients in preventing employee claims and lawsuits, government investigations, and union organizing activity.  We’re in the client service business and know that many labor and employment problems arise without much  warning and require an immediate response. We meet deadlines and provide plenty of advance time where client review of documents is needed. And we communicate with our clients in plain English.

I’ve thrived in environments where innovation is centralized rather than in an incubation lab on the side. Beyond my ability to develop market leader strategy and create first-of-a-kind deals, I’ve also directly managed business operations and P&L’s to achieve significant growth from innovation.  ANALYZING AND CONTEXTUALIZING MACRO ENVIRONMENTS Early in my career, I witnessed the disruptive forces of Napster at Universal Music Group. Because I wanted a solid analytical framework to lead businesses into the future, I earned my MBA from Wharton before accepting the challenge of thinking through how HBO would navigate the disruption to the home video market. I synthesized these market developments into an actionable plan that would expand the P&L and further enhance the monetization of HBO’s original programming worldwide in various formats. Next, I catalyzed HBO’s digital transformation in a culture where long-standing executives were understandably reluctant to upend the viable core cable business. I built HBO’s first digital business from scratch to nearly $100M in annual global revenue and started the relationships with the likes of Amazon, Apple, Google, and others that are the backbone of HBO’s business today.  STEERING THE BUSINESS INTO THE FUTURE I then joined Oculus (a year after Facebook acquired them) to leverage my entertainment industry relationships and create a strategy to broaden product appeal beyond gamers. At the forefront of VR, I strategized with studios, networks, digital services, and record labels on investing in and embracing the platform. Over the past four years, I’ve led Tastemade’s evolution from a social media company to a lifestyle brand. By building a streaming network and brand extensions, I’ve taken it to a broader media portfolio with a growth trajectory and a more favorable market position with its investors and potential acquirers.

We work alongside educators, parents, students, policymakers, and civic and business leaders in communities across the country, providing practical assistance in their efforts to transform schools and colleges into institutions that serve all students well.

We participate actively in national and state policy debates, bringing lessons learned from on-the-ground work and from unflinching data analyses to build the case for policies that will help all students and schools reach high levels of achievement.  Our Core Beliefs: We believe in the power of education to close the gaps that separate low-income students and students of color from other young Americans.   We believe that schools and colleges, appropriately organized, can help virtually all students master the knowledge they need to succeed.    We believe long-standing gaps in opportunity, achievement, and attainment have roots inside and outside of schools.

From power-tools to pharmaceuticals, motorbikes to exports of agricultural produce, the family business was diverse. Naturally, I caught the bug for running and growing businesses, so off I went to study management and finance. The focus has always been about developing the right strategy to address the end-customer’s needs. This has been the constant theme for the last 20+ years.   In 2001, I joined Mechtronix Inc., a true start-up, born out of the engineering labs of Concordia University. It had developed a disruptive technological solution for flight training simulators. Within a few years, I joined the business’ leadership team and helped drive CAGR at +30%.  As VP Business Operations I helped further position Mechtronix as an influential player in the flight simulation industry. After the 2009/2010 financial crisis, I was a key member of the team that led the company’s restructuring, positioning it for further profitable growth.   Later on, I was instrumental in selling Mechtronix to Textron Inc., a strategic buyer who as an aircraft OEM, wanted to enter the flight training simulation market. I also led the negotiation with Textron’s Strategy and M&A team within a 9-month due-diligence process.   Textron’s CEO and Chairman asked me to lead the new business’ (TRU Simulation + Training) commercial airliner P&L as GM & VP Air Transport Simulation. Within TRU Air Transport I oversaw the business’ P&L, including engineering, operations, program management, deliveries, customer service and sales. Some highlights were:   •	Defining the 5-year growth strategy that resulted in the increase of annual revenue 4x, from CDN $40MM to $160MM. •	Capturing US $600MM of new business, including two 10-year exclusive agreements with Boeing for the development of the Flight simulators for the 737Max and the 777-x and a new preferred supplier agreement with Airbus. •	Quintupling (5x) production capacity and setting-up of a customization & delivery center to support customer configuration for a larger throughput. •	Scaling the organization and building effective teams to support the aggressive growth of the business. The overall workforce more than doubled from 150 to just under 400 employees.  Looking forward, I want to leverage this experience to help other businesses grow and establish themselves as key players in their respective markets. This involves putting together the right team to leverage a disruptive technology / business model for the purpose of achieving profitable growth.

He attended Duke University and graduated with Bachelors of Science in Economics in 1999. He returned to his hometown and received his Juris Doctorate from the University of Cincinnati in 2002.   In 2004, Kendle began a small law practice working primarily with small businesses in Northern Virginia. The practice provided litigation, business development, contracting and leasing negotiating services as well as referral service for complex and specialist matters, such as intellectual property.   During this period, Kendle also focused on developing expertise in the hospitality industry, including completing Grande Diplôme at the French Culinary Institute in New York City in 2007. Also, he co-authored a popular cooking blog, ""My Husband Cooks"" (myhusbandcooks.wordpress.com) from 2006 to 2009. At its peak, the blog was well regarded and regularly received over 10,000 unique hits a week and its recipes were reprinted on a number of occasions in newspapers around the country. As result of the blog’s success, Kendle developed an understanding of the important role social media and messaging play in modern marketing.   In 2010, Kendle acquired and developed 3000 Duke Street in Alexandria’s West End as a buyer-ready restaurant complex. He utilized his hospitality and legal skills to recruit and manage a project team of nearly a dozen individuals with diverse skills. The team completed the negotiation of contracts and leases, architectural design and the necessary legal entities and protection. The financial projections were detailed for site and state and local regulatory compliance was assured. The project concluded in   2014 with the sale of the property to an experienced restaurant owner. After the sale, Kendle has returned to the practice of law.

I was drawn to Competency Management after witnessing too many business changes based on  ad-hoc, “intuitive” decisions. For most, the outcomes were disappointing. Even when results were successful, the organizations didn’t know why the changes worked -- leaving leaders equally vulnerable to mysterious failures. I have found that corporations and government organizations that make business decisions based on data -- in this case, on data about workforce skills and competencies --  make better decisions and achieve predictable, repeatable success.   I co-founded Avilar, a leading competency management and eLearning solutions company, to deliver software that does just that — turning proven strategies, processes and best practices into a flexible software solution.  Over the years we’ve helped organizations increase profitability, improve workforce allocation and enhance productivity.

In many fields such as mathematics, computer science and the social sciences, NSF is the major source of federal backing.   NSF awards about 11,000 new awards per year, with an average duration of three years -- to fund specific research proposals that have been judged the most promising by a rigorous and objective merit-review system. In the past few decades, NSF-funded researchers have won more than 200 Nobel Prizes as well as other honors too numerous to list. NSF funds equipment that is needed by scientists and engineers but is often too expensive for any one group or researcher to afford. Another essential element in NSF's mission is support for science and engineering education, from pre-K through graduate school and beyond.   There are many exciting careers at NSF, not only in science, technology, education and mathematics (STEM), but also in business and operations.

A place where your faith and finances can grow together as you seek to serve God and support yourself and your loved ones.  This credit union isn't hypothetical. It's real, and it's called Christian Community Credit Union (CCCU).  Here, you're joining a family who shares your Christian values.  Here, you can serve God AND support yourself and your loved ones.  Here, you can get the right financial solutions to help you live and give more abundantly.  But can't you just find financial services somewhere else?  Sure.  But what other credit union can be your faith-based partner who genuinely cares about a mission bigger than all of us?  What other financial institution seeks to honor God with every transaction?  What other credit union can guarantee your money goes directly to Kingdom purposes?  At CCCU, we seek to honor God in everything we do.  Giving is in our DNA.  And our unique credit card program is just one way we give to Christian causes. Not only do you earn rewards, but with every single purchase, CCCU donates a portion to ministries that work to spread the Gospel, combat human trafficking, and help orphans and foster care children to name a few.  In fact, we've given nearly $6 million to causes our members care about.  Because when you put your money at CCCU, you're helping provide affordable financing to individuals, churches, and ministries.
