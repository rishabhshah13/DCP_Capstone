Our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world, which affects the freedom of people in general.

So we will make an evolutionary development in the Creator economy to the Community Creator economy.  Clubs grew out of my previous business, the Yodvisor platform. Yodvisor was designed to bring together business mentors and entrepreneurs who need the experience and knowledge of other stronger business people. During the pandemic, we made a pivot, as most of our clients stopped using the services. So we began to apply our accumulated experience - creating communities and managing communities.

Will it be GOOD or BAD? üòà  I build websites, and my two aims are: 1) be better than competitors and 2) be discoverable in search.  #1 You must rid of the bad first impression.  We've all experienced the horrors of making a bad first impression (potential date, job interview, public speaking, .etc). It's a dreadful feeling, but even worse, it typically means not getting the opportunity we want.   Your website plays a major role in making a good or bad first impression of you. When potential customers and even referrals land on your website and get confused by the text or find the design not modern or just hard to navigate, they lose confidence in reaching out to you.    The naughty of bad websites: ‚ùå Potential customers lose trust in your abilities versus your competition. ‚ùå Unclear design, confusing (non-punchy) text, and slow-loading websites sway people away.  #2 Leverage your website to be your 24/7 marketing tool that stands above competitors.  On the contrary, a good website can be the secret sauce to good first impressions. Think about it...how many times have you looked at a competitor's website, felt envious, and wished that your website could look like theirs?  We all have, but I believe that if your website shows that you can solve customer problems, that you are genuinely ""enjoyable"" to work with, and is enjoyable to browse because your design and copy are relevant and slick, potential customers will be more willing to reach out.   The secret sauce of good websites: ‚úÖ Customers love to work with those who seem relatable, knowledgeable, and inspiring. ‚úÖ Great design, word clarity, and being discoverable via search engines make you appear as the traits mentioned above and ultimately stand above your competition.  This is the website superpower and a marketing tool that can work for you 24/7.  If you're looking to build a new website, I'd love to learn more. Let's design your good first impression because it's absolute power!  I'm Mike, and I've been designing websites for over a decade, making 200+ websites for businesses and educators. I have also taught web design and marketing to thousands of students worldwide.   More about me here: https://www.webodew.com/about  Stand out. Be found. Win clients!",2,0,8,6,8,6,9,2015,France,

What is Artificial Intelligence?  Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn. It is also a field of study which tries to make computers ""smart""‚Äã. In general use, the term ""artificial intelligence""‚Äã means a machine which mimics human cognition. At least some of the things we associate with other minds, such as learning and problem solving can be done by computers, though not in the same way as we do. Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein define AI as a system‚Äôs ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.  What can an AI digital therapist do?  An AI digital therapist can learn to mimic natural conversation patterns of the mental health professional that created it. This technique is referred to as scripting. Through scripting an AI can be trained to provide general counselling to individuals who suffer from mental health issues 24/7 anywhere around the world. The AI also has built in superpowers such as linguistic and sentiment analysis that allows the machine to automatically uncover important personality insights about the user. These insights can be used for providing more effective therapy. The AI can also be trained to talk through text or simulate voice conversations with the user.

That's where I come in.   Hi! i'm Britt Frank, licensed neuropsychotherapist, personal leadership expert, and author of The Science of Stuck and The Getting Unstuck Workbook (Penguin Random House).  The Shiny Professional Info: I received my BA from Duke University and my MSW from The University of Kansas, where I later became an award-winning adjunct professor. My work has been featured in Forbes, Esquire, The New York Times,  NPR, New York Magazine, Fast Company, SHRM, and Psychology Today.   The Sordid Personal Info: Behind the curtain of my seemingly normal life, I struggled for more than two decades with addiction and anxiety, fully convinced that change was for other people, not for me. When I learned what I now teach, everything changed.  Why This Matters: Personal leadership and peak performance require more than mindset- I teach the simple science of big results.  You DON'T need motivation to overcome procrastination.  You DON'T need to know ""why"" you're stuck to get unstuck.  You DON‚ÄôT need to dive into feelings or empathy to be an effective and human-centered leader.  I deliver actionable, science-backed strategies so you can get yourself and your team back into the driver's seat of life.   What You Get During a Keynote: An entertaining and fast-paced ride filled with fluff-free, practical tools grounded in neuroscience. Everyone knows what it's like to get stuck. And the way forward is simpler than you'd think.  What does LSCSW, SEP mean? LSCSW means I am licensed to practice psychotherapy. SEP means I completed a 3 year post-graduate neuroscience-based training program. Shocking fact-- many psychotherapists are NOT required to learn anything about the brain in graduate school. Strange but true.   When our brains BRAIN better, life gets better. Learn more at www.scienceofstuck.com",2,0,11,2,11,2,,2013,United States,

This perfectly matches his ‚Äúthinking slow‚Äù (strategic, analytical ‚Ä¶) and ‚Äúacting fast‚Äù (decisive, hands-on) personality. This makes it possible to combine a long-term outlook and perseverance to achieve goals and outwork others (both people and companies).    As an ""Architect"" (INTJ) is one of the rarest and most strategically capable personality types (only 2% of the population). INTJ personality types are imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, amazingly curious individuals, but they do not squander their energy.   This has provided a multitude of interesting professional experiences: from helping startups with their MVP, or product management processes, to being part of a sounding, advisory board, or board of directors, to grow startups to multinational, multimillion revenue companies (from a product manager, bot as individual contributor and functional team responsible).   From a personal view-point, the strategic mindset and the will to achieve unique milestones, has made him great in time management and combining a plethora of high value projects and challenges, including both in the private as research sector. All of this hard work, has made it possible to achieve some nice dreams and stability on the life side of the work life balance spectrum. Although Fr√©d√©ric is a strong believer in working hard, doing what you love, high energy, high velocity is possible without having the feeling of a possible looming burnout if you believe in the value of your work, to you, the family and society.   As a founder of Aquila Ventures made me experience the value of helping out startups, and share their highs and lows. The opportunity to found NOWJOBS as product manager with 4 people and nothing but a vision, has made Fr√©d√©ric aware of his impressive analytical, data-driven problem-solving skills, finding innovative and automation solutions for some of the hardest legal and financial challenges in the industry. Driving the strategic product vision, while experiencing the intense growth of NOWJOBS as a company (4 countries, 100 people, 100 million in revenue and a first acquisition) solidified his confidence in product management.   The passion for startups, combined with confidence in his product management skills, has now set the stage for his next big challenge, earning his doctorate in the field of requirements engineering with a focus on software startups. This has a tremendous societal value. Enjoy the ride, enjoy the highs as much as you need to enjoy conquering the lows.",2,0,7,6,7,6,9,2016,Belgium,

The truth about why I‚Äôm so passionate about blockchain?  I heard about Bitcoin several times during my period as a computer science undergrad.  It sounded good but I didn't really pay attention until I started a cybersecurity consulting career.   I must confress, I was initially drawn to the ideas behind public key cryptography, hashes and other geekery.  However, my eyes opened once I started to hear people were making millions with this thing that operates with the same technology, I had now become so familiar with.  So, what was my move?  I soon realized Bitcoin was just the tip of the iceberg. At some point I decided to go all in and jumped into this odyssey called blockchain.  I can not deny it, I also wanted to make a fortune, the same way you probably do. I started in blockchain to make a fortune, but that‚Äôs not the reason I decided to stay.  I now believe that blockchain is the industry that gives you and me the ability to empower humanity with technology, and we can go beyond mere wealth creation.  We now have the power to forge unprecedented opportunities around the globe, we can create value with sheer determination, ambition and a laptop. We can write history with code.  If you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, I do not see coincidence.  I see providence.   Let‚Äôs write history together and empower humanity with technology.

During that time, I was able to gain experience providing direct management and/or oversight for multiple core business areas including, sales and marketing, business development, accounting, human resources, information technology, services, proposal management, legal, security, and research and development.     In 2009, I decided to follow my passion for software, and launched my second business, 5000fish, Inc.  Our flagship product, Yurbi (www.yurbi.com), is an affordable dashboard and reporting software for growing businesses and partners who are looking to embed and white label advanced analytics into their products and services.    As a bootstrapped entrepreneur, I was able to leverage the success of OakTree Solutions to build a powerful enterprise software application that competes head to head with industry giants that are either publically traded or have raised 100s of millions of VC funding.  While my primary focus is on the growth and development of Yurbi, my passion to help other entrepreneurs lead to the creation of the Tech Smart Boss brand in 2017.  Via our weekly podcast (soundcloud.com/techsmartboss), newsletter (newsletter.techsmartboss.com) and YouTube channel (youtube.com/c/techsmartboss), I provide actionable business advice on how to align business process and technology to grow your business with a bootstrapped, lean operations approach.

The four share not only their time by the Bay at the United States Naval Academy, but also a love of fine sports coats, skipping practice parades, and spending time with friends in Downtown Annapolis at Acme, McGarveys or Dillos.   After graduation, as is tradition, all four friends swore to never return to the Yard and PCS‚Äôd to distant parts of the world serving in various positions and posts in the Navy and the Marine Corps, but always keeping in touch and united by their original Jacket Club. After spending four years apart, the original Jacket Club members reunited in San Diego, California. While helping one of the Jacket Club members move houses, the four reminisced on their time at USNA when they found an old ‚ÄúBlue Magnet‚Äù. They realized that although they spent all four years at USNA trying to escape the absurdity of midshipmen life, one thing that they did enjoy at the Academy was catching a nice post noon-meal formation nap, either in or on, the beloved ‚ÄúBlue Magnet‚Äù.   Enter, The Jacket Club.  In order to commemorate the time shared by the Bay, these four friends thought what better way to combine their love of jackets and time shared in The Hall than have an actual piece of the Academy to wear. The Goat Jacket is hand crafted and designed to incorporate a piece of the Naval Academy that we hope present and past midshipmen like us can now wear anywhere around the world from downtown Annapolis to Yokosuka, Japan.  Whether it is on the field at the Navy and Marine Corps Stadium, on the Wesley Brown Track, in the Hall, in Nimitz trying to pass Calculus II, or your Firstie-year Dirt presentation on invading France, we encourage you to find your club that will last a lifetime.

I am excited by the idea of crossing unconventional borders and setting new precedents. I believe in the beauty of precision, the power of hard work, and the necessity of completion. I place a premium on excellent UX and spend my time thinking and creating at the intersection of AI and impactful problem areas.  My work currently revolves around Yuva AI, where I've developed a software platform that develops computer vision AI systems more efficiently and ethically with simulated images and videos. The tool can generate data for all industries and I‚Äôve created the world's first truly representative synthetic human generator for computer vision AI. The framework and tool I developed has been adopted by companies developing AI worth $1B+ annually. These include Fortune 500s and blue-chip venture-backed firms across Europe, North America and APAC.  I believe AI has the potential to help us realise our shared dream of a better future for all of humanity if developed with inclusivity and ethics at its core. As noted in Stanford‚Äôs 100AI report released in September ‚Äò21, AI has made a major leap from the lab to people‚Äôs lives in recent years, which increases the urgency to understand its potential negative effects - a few of which we have already seen materialise in deaths from self driving cars and wrongful incarcerations due to biased facial recognition. I believe that what we do now to understand, guide and develop human-centered AI is setting up the future of generations to come. That reality motivates me. Being privileged to have witnessed first-hand the failures of cutting-edge AI as a teenager, I believe it is more important than ever to build the table for conversations where they need to be happening. While I‚Äôve begun addressing this problem at a technical level with synthetic data, what I‚Äôve realised is that this problem is bigger than a simple software fix. AI will affect every aspect of our lives and our civilization, from social bonds and ethics to the economy and healthcare, education and government.

At The Second Shift, Jenny spearheads community growth, cultivating a network of thousands of expert women and curating events across the country to bring members and business partners together to discuss how to optimize the personal and professional success of working women with a focus on their mental, emotional and spiritual wellness.

We're 5-people strong and we're full steam ahead on building during this bear market. What a time to be alive!  I've been fortunate enough to pull from my experiences from my time as the first engineer at Lumos, an a16z-funded startup on a mission to amplify every person's and every organization's security, collaboration, and productivity! Needless to say, the journey to grow a startup from the ground-up has been incredibly stimulating and fulfilling.  On top of that, my experience as a software engineer on the Azure Kubernetes Service team (AKS) and on the Azure Blockchain team building enterprise-grade blockchain services has given me the skills and tools I need to build scalable and extensible software.  ---- It's hard to define where I'm from, but growing up in the US, Singapore, Japan, and the UK has shaped me into a multicultural individual, passionate to bridge different cultures together.  I find learning about other people's cultures truly fascinating. I love traveling and learning the local language and the way of life. However in our hectic lives, it's often difficult to drop what we're doing and live in another country; we don't even leave time to go out of our way to meet different people living in the same community.  From personal experience, I believe working together on the same team with someone from a different culture can accelerate this learning process. While peoples' beliefs and cultures may be different, I find that many times we share common values and aspirations. My vision is to use technology to allow people from different backgrounds to find and work with each other towards a common goal, which I believe will eliminate cultural barriers and facilitate our understanding of other cultures.  Interesting (and random) idea - wouldn't it be cool if you can see pictures/videos about some topic when someone is talking? A lot of times people can't relate to each other because they just don't share the same background or are imagining different things as they listen. If you can share that emotional factor somehow, both parties could come to a mutual understanding faster. Many ways to share ""emotions"" via technology but photos/videos might be an interesting start!  Shoot me a message if you want to talk! I'd love to get in touch.",2,0,2,2,2,2,1,2022,United States,

No focus on salability 5. Winging the process  We also know that owners don't have spare time to waste - so we've made the plan easy to implement and extremely practical.

It could be that their exit price is way less than expected or the sale doesn‚Äôt even happen.   After decades of deals, I saw that failed exits mostly occur for one or more of these 5 reasons:  1. Little advanced planning 2. Unrealistic goals 3. Theoretical valuations 4. No focus on salability 5. Winging the process   I knew if these 5 problems could be addressed head on it would guarantee a successful exit for the greatest value.   When I tell owners about the 5 problems, they understand. They also realize that the sale of their business is the most important deal they‚Äôll ever do.   But, they tell me there are two more immediate issues: They don‚Äôt know how to get started with exit planning and they have no time to spare.   So I created The Cash Out Plan, a sale planning and advisory service.   It addresses both: a) the 5 reasons exits fail and b) the need for a practical process that time constrained owners can use for a successful exit.   The Cash Out Plan helps business owners:   üëâ Create an exit plan using a practical, time efficient system  üëâ Understand the key steps to reach aggressive value and timing goals  üëâ Determine valuation based on real buyer feedback, not theory  üëâ Fix business issues that could blow up their deal  üëâ Use a tight process to position and market their business, closing with the buyer that pays the most    The Cash Out Plan is based on my 30 years of experience helping business owners realize their financial dreams.
