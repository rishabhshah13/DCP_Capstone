## Overview
Duke Capital Partners (DCP) is initiating a project to develop an internal sourcing tool aimed at identifying Duke University affiliated startup companies seeking funding, which leverages the power of the Duke network to support the universityâ€™s entrepreneurial ecosystem.
## Key Feature
-Implement advanced filtering system and scoring system which could be directly used upon the raw dataset, enable users (DCP members) to search for Duke-related companies they are interested in (including startups) based on specific criteria such as Duke afiliation, industry, company size, company description etc.
- Filtering system: The goal of this system is to filter out irrelevant features from our raw datasets, and only keep the features that DCP members care about.
- Scoring system: The goal of this system is to score each company on the list based on its features, in order for DCP members to find the companies they are interested in.
## Data Source
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (used for the model training)
- Harmonic AI
## Methodology
### Heuristics Model to filter out irrelevant features
- Algorithmic scoring model with 10 weighted criteria based on LinkedIn company factors
- Manually evaluated by DCP team for sorted results aligning with their target companies
- Mostly used for filtering out unwanted metrics from the classification metric
### NLP model quantify company description
- Fine tuning Bert to do a multiclass classification to classify the company description (one of the features of our data) based on part of the collected data with manually assigned labels. (0 = not relevant at all,
	1 = startup companies with Duke connections,
	2 = worth our time!
)
