Then, I quit. Today, I'm a Human Factors Engineer helping other PhDs launch fulfilling non-academic careers.  The long version:  By every metric, my research program on early childhood emotional development was highly successful. In 2019, after I completed my PhD in Developmental Psychology, I received a prestigious post-doctoral fellowship from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).   I also won two dissertation awards: the 2020 Dissertation Award in the Social Sciences from the University of Washington and the 2021 Dissertation Award in Developmental Psychology from the American Psychological Association (APA). I published fifteen first-author papers, which have been cited over 500 times.  But at a certain point, none of that mattered to me anymore. I had just turned 30, and I was a third-year post-doc with no academic job prospects. I was staring down a fourth (and potentially fifth) year as an underpaid and under-appreciated post-doc without career security.  I had no guarantee that I would land a faculty position in a place that I wanted to live, or felt safe living as a queer person. And, as a neurodivergent person who manages a stress-related disorder, my mental health was becoming worse and worse. How much more was I willing to give for this career?   I decided to quit. On January 24, 2022, I posted on Twitter that I was leaving academia. The tweet went viral. I continued to write about my career transition, offering free career advice and verbalizing the emotions that many academics shared but were afraid to express.  Today, I'm a Human Factors Engineer at Arthrex, developing digital technology to assist orthopedic surgeons. I earn more, work less, and feel so much happier compared to my academic career. And I’m on a mission to help other PhDs follow in my footsteps.  Why? Because I remember how lost and alone I felt during my career transition - I never want anyone else to feel this way. With resources and support, you too can launch a fulfilling non-academic career. You don't need to struggle like I did. Because you have value as a PhD.  You just need a strategy.   💛  P.S. - visit www.ashleyruba.com to learn my step-by-step strategy :)",no,no,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,10.0,2023,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5603AQEcoGcekX4nTw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1697636939873?e=1711584000&v=beta&t=hoVOTNdZBW2sMsPqtlmGLa06LX3mhf6aNNi7nLrVh3Q,United States,Seattle,0

I grew up in Northern Virginia and later attended Duke University where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Economics. I was also an active member of Kappa Alpha Psi, Fraternity incorporated, while serving as an economics teacher's assistant while at Duke.  Following college, I attended Virginia Commonwealth University's School of Medicine in Richmond, Virginia where I served as class president and earned my medical degree.  After completing my medical education, I pursued residency training in Emergency Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, a top-ranked hospital and research institution affiliated with the Icahn School of Medicine. During my time there, I honed my clinical skills and developed a passion for improving patient care through innovative solutions.  Following my residency, I moved to South Florida where I worked as an Emergency Physician and Assistant Medical Director at Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, later serving as Facility Medical Director at North Shore Medical Center in Miami, Florida. During this time, I saw firsthand the challenges that healthcare organizations faced in terms of staffing and productivity. I also saw how these challenges negatively impacted patient care.  Driven by a desire to improve healthcare staffing and productivity, I enrolled in business school while leading a team of physicians during the coronavirus pandemic. In 2022, I graduated from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, where I was voted to be the student graduation speaker by my classmates, and earned my MBA degree. This experience gave me a unique perspective on the intersection of healthcare and business, and inspired me to start my own staffing firm.  In November 2022, I left my job as a medical director to start SMC, bringing SMC reforms and productivity-based compensation models to client hospitals. Our innovative approach is what is needed to save healthcare in the post-pandemic medical environment, and I am committed to improving patient care through our work!

The Green Vue team worked on the launch of the cell phone industry for AT&T, the banking industry’s first home equity line of credit for what is now Bank of America, the grocery industry’s first loyalty card (Wegmans) and P&G’s most successful new product launch.  What did all these clients have in common? They had the rare ability to ‘see around the corner.’ That’s where we are today with the Green economy. Companies of all sizes and specialties know they need a strategy for dealing with climate change. The challenge is knowing when your customers are ready to embrace new, often costlier green products – whether that’s electric vehicles, sustainable consumer goods, eco-tourism or hundreds of others.  To help clients deal with the Green challenge and opportunity, we have built a suite of data products that make it easier to plan for and take advantage of the coming Green wave. It starts by knowing which regions, cities, counties and even neighborhoods show the greatest interest in going Green. Our Green Vue Neighborhoods answer those questions.  When you’re ready to reach Green early adopters directly as well as start nurturing the likely Green early majority and tailor messages that will resonate with them, our Green Vue Personas can tell you who, where and how many to reach anywhere in the US. And if you want to reach those same Green consumers on-line, our Digital Audience Affinities are being onboarded for your use.  www.greenvues.com ",8,"Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States","Is the Green economy ready to take off?  In short, the answer is Yes!  We’re at a critical inflection point much like the web was in 2000 and cell phones were when the iPhone appeared in 2008. But just 2.3% of US vehicle sales in 2020 were electric -- yet the target for automakers is 100% for 2035!   That means there are still enormous opportunities to get in position to ride the Green wave. The challenge for marketers is knowing not just who the earliest adopters are but who will make up the early majority and what will it take to motivate them to action.  I’ve had the opportunity to work on many different breakthrough market launches. No matter how large the budget or what resources were available the most difficult hurdles to overcome were predicting what’s next when you cannot rely on past data. Henry Ford’s famous quote – “if I only listened to what consumers wanted, I would have built them a faster horse” – is worth remembering.   In our data driven world today, all the machine learning tools do a great job of predicting what’s right in front of us but they’re not so good at predicting sea changes in behavior. We work on that challenge every day at Green Vues. Who’s willing to pay a little more to go Green? Who’s unwilling to buy an electric vehicle because they don’t think they’re ready yet?

Our staff is some of the most networked individuals in the medical laboratory space. We’ll help you find what you’re looking for without the hassle.  Buyer Services: We have heard many buyers complain that it’s hard to find labs for sale because they often are not listed anywhere. Laboratory Nexus offers a network that is the missing link between clinical lab buyers and sellers. Our Buying + Selling Team will help you find the right clinical laboratory as well as empower you to make the right decision.  Seller Services: There are many reasons lab owners decide to sell a lab. Whether it’s due to financial issues, retirement, or otherwise, we know timing is key. We often hear sellers say that they had a hard time finding a platform on which to advertise their lab. This is because laboratories aren’t commonly listed publicly, and many sell by word of mouth. Laboratory Nexus is the missing link between lab sellers and lab buyers. We provide a marketplace to list the full details of your lab so you’re not missing buyer opportunities, and we work closely with you to ensure your lab is sold quickly and hassle-free.  Many labs aren’t publicly listed, which is a huge inconvenience for buyers. However, we have the network to stay ahead of the lab market, bringing you options sooner. We work with sellers and have access to lab owners whom we can approach about selling. We can provide expert opinions when it comes to valuations, as well as assistance with purchase negotiations.

Vaginal drug delivery is often the optimum delivery approach to achieve these objectives, and IVR technology has become one of our preferred investigational platforms. Our portfolio features innovative IVR technologies including our non-hormonal contraceptive Ovaprene®, which we believe has the potential to disrupt the contraceptive landscape by providing protection for one month, without the use hormones, and our suite of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) matrixed IVRs that can provide flexibility in terms of drug loading, drug delivery, and modulation of release rates across a wide array of molecules, hormones, peptides and proteins, facilitating new indications and applications of the technology.  Daré’s EVA IVR technology includes DARE-HRT1 for dual hormone replacement as a potential treatment for the vasomotor symptoms of menopause and DARE-FRT1 for vaginal progesterone delivery in support of fertility and the prevention of pre-term birth. In addition to its novel IVR technologies, Daré is developing a topical formulation of sildenafil, the active ingredient in the blockbuster product Viagra®, for the treatment of female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) as well as a novel vaginal formulation of the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen to address and alleviate the symptoms of vulvar vaginal atrophy (VVA) for women diagnosed with and treated for hormone-receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer.",2868,"San Diego County, California, United States","With an entrepreneurial spirit and a reputation for executing complex financial transactions and deals, I am a strong leader within the biopharmaceutical sector.

With our tech-enabled, stainless steel system, users check out and return containers just like a library book! Our trackable app ensures user accountability, which allows our beautiful stainless steel containers to last over 3 years and has led to a whopping 99% return rate. We work with colleges, universities, and communities to make the switch to returnables easy.

So I decided to do something about it.   I’ve since helped hundreds of people position themselves to build their ideal career through speaking engagements, workshops, individualized coaching, and resume & LinkedIn profile writing.",17,"New York, New York, United States","SUPERPOWER Resumes are my superpower. I didn’t discover this unique, yet practical skill until several years ago when two women in tech pointed out that I find mistakes in every resume I read.   Initially dubious about how I could make a difference with this newfound ability, an “Elle Woods moment” sealed my fate. Instead of setting my sights on Harvard Law School, though, I decided to speak about resumes at the Ivy League of women in tech conferences, the annual Grace Hopper Celebration.   “What, like it’s hard?”  Actually, it is hard. The workshop proposal that my co-speaker and I submitted in 2014 was rejected. But I channeled Elle’s perseverance and submitted two proposals the next year.  SPEAKING EXPERIENCE In 2015, I spoke at the Grace Hopper Celebration twice! My path into resume coaching steadily continued as I turned:  • an 8-minute resume exercise into • a 20-minute resume talk into • an hour-long resume workshop  I’ve facilitated a total of eight different sessions at Grace Hopper events and given 25+ resume workshops virtually and in person for companies, college groups, veteran organizations, and conferences.  COACHING EXPERIENCE At every speaking adventure, I meet incredible women in tech whose skills and experiences don’t translate to their resume. This is a potential career catastrophe: a well-written resume is sometimes the difference between getting a job at your first choice company versus grudgingly accepting the only offer you receive from a firm at the bottom of your list.  Since 2015, I’ve had the privilege of working with hundreds of people on their resumes, and now it’s my full-time mission to help women in tech confidently pursue their career desires. I help my clients create resumes that are eye-catching, concise, direct, and totally them.  ""I think it gives it a little something extra, don’t you think?”  PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE Before starting my own LLC, I worked at IBM as a Product Support Engineer and Palantir Technologies as a Product Support Team Lead and Project Manager.

Are you tired of feeling disappointed with yourself when you’ve lost it, yet again?  Are you finally ready to get rid of your anger issues once and for all?  I’ve been there.  I totally understand, and it’s not your fault!  Yes, you read that right, it’s not your fault. The way we are traditionally taught to understand and deal with our anger can leave us feeling even more angry and frustrated!  After working with people from every walk of life over the last 40 years, writing 23 books on eliminating (not managing) anger and stress, and sponsoring National Stress Awareness Month in the U.S. every April since 1992, I’ve come to appreciate that most people have the following challenges when dealing with anger:  ❌ Relying on techniques that just mask the problem…and don’t get rid of it ❌ Burying their anger, which only makes it worse in the long term ❌ Working with anger management counselors/therapists for years with minimal results  When I work with clients, they love the results because:  ✅ In 10 weeks they’ve learned how to eradicate their anger issues, not just manage them ✅ They finally feel in control of their anger and their life ✅ Their relationships with their family, friends, and colleagues get better  Many of my clients, when we begin working together, think they’re beyond help because they’ve tried everything else. But there’s always hope, they can and do get better, as shown by some examples below:  A 66-year-old retired man came to me for help as he’d been angry all his life. In only 10 sessions with me, he could finally eliminate his anger and control his emotions. He even stopped getting angry on the golf course, which he had done for many years.   A single mother of a special needs child kept getting furious with her daughter when she repeatedly misbehaved. When we finished working together, she no longer got furious with her child and was able to be constructive in the way she handled misbehavior.   A 3 time Emmy-winning TV producer had been holding onto both past and present anger issues. It was affecting him in almost every area of life. In just 10 sessions, he was finally able to let those issues go and is now living a balanced and more happy life.

I'm a lefty. I learned an important lesson in kindergarten while failing to replicate what I saw the rest of my class do with apparent ease - cut out a paper turkey. The lesson is that even if something looks right, a small misalignment can cause failure unless you learn and adapt to succeed.  I find that a lot of organizations are left handed and trying to use scissors made for the wrong-handed part of the population, something I'm very familiar with. That's where skilled leaders come into play.  I enjoy dealing with ambiguity and chaos. I embrace it; it's where fun happens and learning begins. If you or your company is struggling with where you are, where to go, or how to get there, I can and will help.  I've stepped into multiple organizations, programs, and projects that were off the rails and led successful recoveries to get them where they needed to be. I've also built products and teams from zero to one. Greatness comes from many different places.  It comes down to setting a energizing, inclusive vision and then empowering the organization for all-in execution - build the drive and right frame of mind and the sky's the limit (unless you're SpaceX or NASA).  - I speak business, techie, operations, marketing, customer, and delicate situation. Solving a problem starts with building a shared understanding, and miscommunication prevents understanding.  - I don't flinch. I stay calm and run towards the fire.  - I strive to accelerate my team, peers, and leadership by taking on the role that fits the situation, whether that's being a sounding board, rubber duck (I love debugging), trusted advisor, coach, or final decision maker.   - I have fun at work, and I aim to make work fun and worthwhile for others.  Drop me a note if you want to talk product, sports, business, or technology. I enjoy learning new ideas and perspectives from new people.",yes,yes,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2023,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQHf7YdVY8hXZQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1623300451683?e=1711584000&v=beta&t=c6c-T0zauEICIuxhTA9nVDWCSRq8yXvX81skKd1p5tE,Unknown,Unknown,0

People are confused, because things don't quite add up from their first impressions about me.   Some perceive me as a spoiled child who has never known hardship. Some perceive me as just a man, with nothing to contribute to solving women's issues. Some perceive me as just another cookie-cutter Asian nerdy tech guy. Others see me as ""too nice"" and therefore weak.  These first impressions couldn't be further from the truth.  The truth is that my life's struggles made me who I am, and I have made NeuEve the way it is.  As a child, I was shaped by two complete opposite goals and struggles. 1. I wanted to be extraordinary and change the world. 2. Deep down, all I really wanted was to be normal and accepted.  Let me you a paint a picture.  A shy, sensitive, bright Asian kid growing up fast like a beanstalk, in a middle class town in Kansas. The only Asian family for miles and miles around. I was blessed and cursed with a gift. The gift of being extremely smart.  I wanted to be liked, I wanted to have friends, I wanted my crush to like me back.  My mom, Dr. Renjie Chang, also desperately wanted me to be liked (as she was once very popular, back in China). Her advice to me was that people like you more when you get better grades.  So I did my duty. I completely demolished every single quiz and test. 100's all across the board.  The better I did in school, the more the other kids disliked me. ""Teacher's Pet!"" ""Smart Aleck!"" I felt more isolated and less accepted.  My childhood was like being a fly stuck in a spider web. I had a goal: to be liked and accepted. And the harder I tried, the farther from that goal I got.  I remember feeling angry and confused often. The more others attacked me, the more hardened I felt in my identity.  —  At age 12, I remember watching Pay It Forward for the first time. This movie inspired me and it gave me a hope and a vision for a way out of my dilemma.  In the movie, this optimistic boy decides to invent an idea to change the world. It's simple: do 3 big things for 3 people. And after you do these big things, ask them to do 3 big things for 3 other people! It's basically a pyramid scheme or chain-letter of kindness. In the movie, the boy successfully changes the world and becomes a timeless hero.  I started believing that, maybe if I could change the world, people would finally like me and accept me.  —  Continued at >> https://www.neueve.com/pages/kevin-tao",no,no,10.0,1.0,10.0,1.0,1.0,2014,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQEH-67TyV9dcA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1630696973825?e=1711584000&v=beta&t=-bWnCpv5o2SfcXV1ce6LOL67hP1L0mxNCidklxYuHJI,United States,Arlington Heights,0

When learning is relevant, it resonates today with a learner’s interests, culture, context, community, identity, abilities, and experiences, while allowing room for exposure and growth. It also prepares learners for the future, in which interdisciplinary skills like creativity, problem-solving, critical thinking, and collaboration will be increasingly salient.  When learning is equitable, more supports and opportunities are afforded to those of greatest need. Based on national and regional research, this means particular attention is paid to working alongside, as well as uplifting and supporting the voices, strength, and potential of: learners in poverty; learners of color; learners in rural areas; girls in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math); and learners with exceptionalities.
