We have helped create a global community of people interested in engaging in the intellectual process of asking questions about Arab history and culture and investigating to find answers.   Every month. we host monthly salon-style events that feature two presentations on topics related to the Arab history and culture. Each presentation is given by a member of the afikra and is centered around a specific question that they were curious about and were motivated to research. Presentations are 45 minutes and can be structured however the presenter chooses. Our first chapter started in Brooklyn in 2014 and we have now expanded to Washington DC, Montreal, Dubai and soon Beirut.   Each chapter is run by a small team of dedicated volunteers who help organize the events and support the presenters as they complete their research.

What is Artificial Intelligence?  Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn. It is also a field of study which tries to make computers ""smart""‚Äã. In general use, the term ""artificial intelligence""‚Äã means a machine which mimics human cognition. At least some of the things we associate with other minds, such as learning and problem solving can be done by computers, though not in the same way as we do. Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein define AI as a system‚Äôs ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.  What can an AI digital therapist do?  An AI digital therapist can learn to mimic natural conversation patterns of the mental health professional that created it. This technique is referred to as scripting. Through scripting an AI can be trained to provide general counselling to individuals who suffer from mental health issues 24/7 anywhere around the world. The AI also has built in superpowers such as linguistic and sentiment analysis that allows the machine to automatically uncover important personality insights about the user. These insights can be used for providing more effective therapy. The AI can also be trained to talk through text or simulate voice conversations with the user."

1,"A stealth startup is a startup company that operates in stealth mode, i.e. that avoids public attention. This may be done to hide information from competitors, or ‚Äî as part of a marketing strategy ‚Äî to manage public image. The phenomenon is well known in the venture capital (VC) community. Normally a company would only operate in stealth mode for the first couple of years. As investors may have to disclose funding a stealth startup, their names are made public, but often only a general summary description is known about the company. ""Most entrepreneurs say they are in stealth because they are worried about competitors stealing their ideas. This can be a risk if you have such a simple idea that just by hearing it, someone can replicate it.""‚Äã"

Founded by Tio and Kenzel Fallen, Three Keys Coffee explores the connection between art, music, and coffee through vibrant bag design, curated Spotify playlists to pair with each roast, and top-quality, award-winning coffee.  Three Keys takes its inspiration from Jazz, deriving its name from the valves of the trumpet‚Äîan instrument of simplicity that uses just three keys to produce notes across a creative and complex range of tonal outputs.   The trumpet is a personal connection to our origin story, with co-founder Tio Fallen having played the trumpet for over 15 years including for the renowned FAMU Marching 100. Coffee became a passion for both Tio and his wife/co-founder, Kenzel after traveling to coffee-producing regions and exploring the art of home-roasting. Tio has a professional background in mechanical engineering so he was intrigued by the science of roasting but also drawn to the art of creating coffee, reminiscent of the artistic freedom and creativity of creating music.   Three Keys Coffee has been consumed in over 500 cities within all 50 states, as well as internationally. We have been featured in Bloomberg, Sprudge, Food & Wine, Fortune, NBC News, Katie Couric Online, and Imbibe magazine.

0,"A stealth startup is a startup company that operates in stealth mode, i.e. that avoids public attention. This may be done to hide information from competitors, or ‚Äî as part of a marketing strategy ‚Äî to manage public image. The phenomenon is well known in the venture capital (VC) community. Normally a company would only operate in stealth mode for the first couple of years. As investors may have to disclose funding a stealth startup, their names are made public, but often only a general summary description is known about the company. ""Most entrepreneurs say they are in stealth because they are worried about competitors stealing their ideas. This can be a risk if you have such a simple idea that just by hearing it, someone can replicate it.""‚Äã"

No matter who you are or where you are starting, it‚Äôs more than support through challenge - it‚Äôs the foundation to grow, heal and lead lives that are more resilient, empathic, hopeful and powerful.  Everyone should have the opportunity to receive personalized therapy, and therapists should be able to serve the communities they care about most, not just the 10% of people who can afford to pay out of pocket.  Our mission is to get more people into therapy by bridging the gap between therapists and people seeking mental health care.  Grow Therapy empowers independent therapists to launch and grow thriving in-network private practices by enabling them to tap into large scale credentialing, referrals, administrative and community support enabled by our passionate team and technology.  When therapists no longer have the hassle of mundane admin tasks like billing and insurance claims or the limitations of out-of-pocket-only payment options, they can provide care to the communities who need it most!  To achieve our lofty ambitions, we‚Äôre building an ambitious team of entrepreneurs and mission-driven go-getters. Our founders come from Harvard Medical School, Stripe, and Blackstone, and bring Grow‚Äôs mission to life from the inside-out, promoting holistic wellness for all team members.

0,"Born out of a necessity during a surprisingly rainy New York City evening in May of 2017, The Jacket Club was founded by four best friends: Hale, Zach, Chandler, and Roberto. The four share not only their time by the Bay at the United States Naval Academy, but also a love of fine sports coats, skipping practice parades, and spending time with friends in Downtown Annapolis at Acme, McGarveys or Dillos.   After graduation, as is tradition, all four friends swore to never return to the Yard and PCS‚Äôd to distant parts of the world serving in various positions and posts in the Navy and the Marine Corps, but always keeping in touch and united by their original Jacket Club. After spending four years apart, the original Jacket Club members reunited in San Diego, California. While helping one of the Jacket Club members move houses, the four reminisced on their time at USNA when they found an old ‚ÄúBlue Magnet‚Äù. They realized that although they spent all four years at USNA trying to escape the absurdity of midshipmen life, one thing that they did enjoy at the Academy was catching a nice post noon-meal formation nap, either in or on, the beloved ‚ÄúBlue Magnet‚Äù.   Enter, The Jacket Club.  In order to commemorate the time shared by the Bay, these four friends thought what better way to combine their love of jackets and time shared in The Hall than have an actual piece of the Academy to wear. The Goat Jacket is hand crafted and designed to incorporate a piece of the Naval Academy that we hope present and past midshipmen like us can now wear anywhere around the world from downtown Annapolis to Yokosuka, Japan.  Whether it is on the field at the Navy and Marine Corps Stadium, on the Wesley Brown Track, in the Hall, in Nimitz trying to pass Calculus II, or your Firstie-year Dirt presentation on invading France, we encourage you to find your club that will last a lifetime. Until then, welcome in."

Our mission is to lower costs in the laboratory industry and reduce biohazard waste in the environment by delivering groundbreaking approaches in dealing with plastic consumables.   Every year, over 5 million pounds of plastic pipette tips are disposed of in landfills globally after a single use. This drives significant environmental pollution and unnecessary costs. The typical laboratory consumes several thousand pipette tips every day for samples and assay procedures, due to the lack of options for safely cleaning plastic consumables. Such high consumption of plastic tips adds $25,000 to $1.5 million in annual operational costs for laboratories worldwide.  At Grenova‚Ñ¢, we know that high consumption of plastic tips is an excessive, avoidable operational cost for companies and a significant contributor to environmental pollution. This is why we decided to create devices that enable labs to wash and recycle pipette tips in large quantities. Grenova devices offer labs the option to reuse plastic tips several times, cutting associated costs by up to 90%. Grenova devices are safe for both the user and the environment, without producing hazardous waste or gases.  visit us at: www.grenovasolutions.com"

0,"A stealth startup is a startup company that operates in stealth mode, i.e. that avoids public attention. This may be done to hide information from competitors, or ‚Äî as part of a marketing strategy ‚Äî to manage public image. The phenomenon is well known in the venture capital (VC) community. Normally a company would only operate in stealth mode for the first couple of years. As investors may have to disclose funding a stealth startup, their names are made public, but often only a general summary description is known about the company. ""Most entrepreneurs say they are in stealth because they are worried about competitors stealing their ideas. This can be a risk if you have such a simple idea that just by hearing it, someone can replicate it.""‚Äã"

The PUMA Platform will disrupt multiple medical procedures, reducing health care costs, and improving efficiency, safety, quality, patient experience, and access to services around the globe.   Invented by Dr. Steven Tropello, a Johns Hopkins-trained critical care physician, the PUMA System enables diagnostic, interventional and therapeutic procedures in hollow organs. The system combines magnetic attraction for device placement guidance, and ubiquitous, low-cost, point-of-care ultrasound for visualization in hollow cavities. Our lead device, the PUMA-G, selected because of its low risk, clear FDA pathway, and strong commercial viability, is for the insertion of Gastrostomy (feeding) tubes.   PUMA-G enables a point-of-care (i.e. bedside, as opposed to operating room) procedure for inserting gastrostomy tubes which can be quickly and easily performed by non-surgical providers. By eliminating specialty suites and specialist consultants, PUMA-G will save hospitals money and improve efficiency and safety for this common procedure. PUMA-G has been validated in human anatomy, and has a streamlined regulatory pathway based on FDA presubmission feedback."

""SMART Digital Marketing"" has 5 foundational pillars:  1.	""S"" stands for Strategic. Having led blue-chip multinationals in several countries, I understand the importance of placing Digital Marketing in its wider strategic and cultural context.  2.	""M"" stands for ""Marketing"". Having been Marketing Director of L¬¥Or√©al and CEO of an international communications agency, I understand that Digital Marketing is a powerful element of a wider marketing mix that should be aligned from the outset with broader branding values.  3.	""A"" stands for ""Analysis"". Having qualified as a Certified Digital Marketer, I understand the data driven nature of the Digital Marketing discipline. Creative ideas are only valid if they can be tested and proven to be effective through data-driven analysis.   4.	""R"" stands for ""Results"".  Having been CEO of companies with full P&L responsibility, I know how important it is, prior to any campaign, to create measurable goals or KPIs, whether they be increase in brand awareness, engagement or sales, and to base development discussion around them on insights from real tangible results.   5.	""T"" stands for ""Time"". Having founded several entrepreneurial businesses, I understand the importance of the short-term and the long-term and, as a top business executive coach, the need to maintain partnership relationships that deliver results collaboratively over both time periods, achieving quick wins while building brand values for the future.   The ‚ÄúSMART‚Äù business philosophies are available in a book I share with clients entitled ""Digital Marketing: SMART Skills I learnt on the road"".
