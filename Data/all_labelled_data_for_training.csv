Those improvements in quality care translate into lives saved, illnesses avoided and costs reduced.   NCQA consistently raises the bar.

During the pandemic, I pivoted my career and dove headfirst into the effort to prevent and fight COVID by developing operating models to get people tested where it was needed most; by establishing a statewide testing program for students, faculty, and teachers; by building an international team of 40 trained telemedicine officers working around the clock; and by establishing much needed lab capacity in Los Angeles for 4,200 PCR tests per day.

Yes, occasionally, it requires some technical expertise. But what I’ve found binds successful practitioners in the space are three key traits:  - Passion for the work; - Fairness and equity at the fore; - Community voice as the anchor.  I’m no expert in any of this stuff.  But I try, and I try real hard to listen to, and learn, from others who are experts in this stuff.  By doing so - in close collaboration with team members and partners - I believe that we’ve accomplished some good: launched several multi-million dollar poverty-fighting campaigns; incubated technology solutions designed to improve the lives of low-income families; scaled initiatives for greater impact. And no matter the effort - whether it’s providing meaningful pathways into high-demand jobs for those on the downward slope of the K-shaped Covid economy; or ensuring equitable distribution and digital binding for Covid vaccinations in the Global South; or offering alternative financing mechanisms for low-income college students (some of the issues I work on) - doing so with fairness, equity, and community voice as the pillar is paramount, and in my experience produces the best results!  So this has been my life in the social sector.  Earlier in my career, I was a lawyer. I then founded and led an Internet-based educational software company in the U.S. to a successful exit.  I subsequently worked at Bain & Company as an Associate Partner, before shifting to the social sector. First at the Robin Hood Foundation, New York City's largest private foundation.  And now at SkillUp Coalition, helping individuals secure high opportunity employment.  I'm a Mentor at Techstars supporting early stage startups.

Key features of PSO include:  •	Integrated “multi-cycle” representation of decision processes used in the control room; •	Ability to optimize and simulate “recourse” and “non-recourse” decisions at each decision point in each cycle; •	Quantitative assessment of impacts that imperfect forecasts have on operator decisions and the deployment of reliability services; •	Efficient management of large amounts of forecast data, automatically matching each forecast to decision, allowing users to quickly assess the value of increased flexibility and improved forecasts.  •	Generalized reserve models that support new ancillary-service definitions. •	Transparent and computationally efficient simulation that can be used to “play out” operational results from deployment of reserves to meet system variability and uncertainty.

I was raised by a strong single mother who taught me the value of hard work and resilience.   After high school, I attended a local college and began to realize the importance of education.  With awesome motivation from my professors, I excelled and moved to Los Angeles to attend Loyola Law School. I became a lawyer, got married, and had two amazing children.   𝐅𝐑𝐎𝐌 𝐋𝐀𝐖 𝐓𝐎 𝐒𝐎𝐂𝐈𝐀𝐋 𝐈𝐌𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐓 🌎  As a street lawyer, I helped people on Skid Row gain access to the assistance they needed, providing pro bono social and legal services.  Serving my community was very fulfilling and impactful so I decided to take it up a notch. I earned a Master’s Degree in Public Policy from Duke University and shifted my career from law to social impact.  Since then, I’ve spent the past three decades leading teams and organizations in collaborative efforts to improve the lives of people who are struggling.  I’ve created homes for thousands of housing-insecure people, raised over $300M in funding and donations, and led 25 affordable housing real estate projects/transactions of all sizes and funding types including state, federal, and private.   𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐃𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐓𝐄𝐀𝐌𝐒 - 𝐄𝐒𝐆 | 𝐃𝐄𝐈 😀  As a leader, I am at my best putting out fires and motivating people to achieve collective goals.  I’ve also spearheaded diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts while communicating performance, financial information, and social impact achievements to a broad set of stakeholders.    My happiest professional moments have been mentoring my team members to grow in their careers and seeing them go on to major leadership roles.  As a compassionate leader, I live by the Ralph Waldo Emerson quote: “...to find the best in others…This is to have succeeded.”  𝐋𝐄𝐓'𝐒 𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐂𝐓 𝐎𝐍 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐄𝐃𝐈𝐍 👉🏼  Outside of work, I like to spend time with my family, whether that’s at home cooking and gardening or traveling on adventures, like mountain climbing, skiing, fishing and biking.

All of that effort comes down to one goal--I help people win contracts, so they can execute their dreams.  I like hard problems no one has solved. If you can find a treatise on a topic with Google, then I am probably not very interested (but I still take on problems like that as a favor to clients). This kind of problem solving is what I have spent my career doing for the government and for the private sector.  It is the intersection of RDT&E/Production and cultivation of the resources necessary to execute—early adoption of novel and/or disruptive technology often depends very heavily on those spaces being represented in the larger capture effort.   Senior executive/technical professional with more than 20 years of management experience buttressed by more than 25 years of technical work experience building and managing technical teams to solve complex challenges in transitioning new technology to the field—from the role of evaluator for the government to the role of innovator to the private sector. - Demonstrated ability to identify, develop and shape opportunity in the capture cycle (particularly USG) - Winning proposal development for tech clients - Focused on rapid innovation of customer solutions in the commercial, space, and national security sectors - Expertise in matching customer requirements to existing and developmental products and services - Long experience in chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear/explosive (CBRNE) intelligence and RDT&E (oversight of approximately $8B) - History of successful military/corporate strategic planning and contingency analyses (Contamination Avoidance for Military Mail System was just validated with the aircraft carrier COVID-19 outbreak) - Documented track record of communicating effectively with senior government, military and corporate officers, resulting in growth of existing engagements as well as new starts - Broad analytical and technical scope coupled with extensive national policy-making experience - Skilled at motivating and leading large multidisciplinary teams - Possess an active TS clearance - Multiple patents filed/granted",2,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2019.0,

My balanced approach to arts and education nurtures and fosters corporate cultures representative of the communities they serve by overcoming cultural biases, socio-economic challenges, and obstacles that prevent people from expressing themselves through the arts.  I have a passion for arts and education and a reputation for growing earned and unearned income at companies I have led.  At The Cleveland Opera, I charted a clear path for a safe return to the stage in the aftermath of COVID-19 restrictions and proposed increased civic participation through educational initiatives and collaborations with organizations including Karamu House, the nation's oldest producing African American theatre.  At Charlottesville Opera, I mounted a successful 2020 summer festival and introduced the company's first small production in an alternative venue. Individual contributed income grew by 35%.  In Amarillo, I worked with over 150 educational and social service organizations to strengthen the region's cultural fabric by making arts participation and attendance free for thousands of individuals that would have otherwise not had access to the arts. The season grew from four to seven productions—and four to twenty-three performances. Contributed annual income grew 111% to more than $1M. I produced nine LatinX, six African-American, two Native American-themed productions, and an acclaimed production of Brundibar. I was the company's executive producer and on-air host of a collaboration that aired annual productions on PBS.  Previously, I served as Director of Development at the Wisconsin Historical Foundation, where I helped plan and execute a successful $77M capital campaign and secured funding for the Historical Society's $20M annual budget. I also served as CEO of Opera for the Young, and Triangle Opera in North Carolina and on the faculty of Amarillo College.  I have held memberships in the Association of Performing Arts Professionals, OPERA America, the National Opera Association, the Association of Fundraising Professionals, the NAACP, Actor's Equity, and the American Guild of Musical Artists.

My income planning practice specializes in a process called “Red Light on the Dashboard,” which measures longevity as a baseline of retirement income duration.  Longevity is causally related to wealth in retirement. Then the process focuses on tax efficiency, keeping in mind that all income is not taxed the same way, nor is everyone’s definition of a comfortable retirement. Red Light on the Dashboard creates a custom blueprint for retirement unique to each client.   The firm works with individuals and business executives close to retirement, retirees who are dissatisfied with their results. The firm also works with people for whatever reason have taken early retirement.  We have a specialty in working with widows.    My “Red Light on the Dashboard”  process will create a custom blueprint to fit each unique person. No two plans are alike.   Some of the tools used include: Social Security claiming strategies, pensions, IRAs,  401ks, Roth’, insurance, and other assets including brokerage accounts to meet retirement goals in the most tax-efficient manner possible.   Some of the components of  “Red Light on the Dashboard” process may include:  ✔️Longevity planning   ✔️Cash flow planning and budget modeling ✔️Income planning to leverage your retirement income sources based on their tax location, to  maximize retirement portfolio assets  ✔️Stress testing by scenario, , Monte Carlo simulation of  income and investment alternatives, tax modeling using high-quality risk mitigation software  ✔️Social Security timing analysis to provide alternate claiming strategies  ✔️Strategic tax planning to pay taxes at the lowest effective marginal rate  ✔️Determine each persons’ “risk premium” and Behavioral analysis related to investing and risk tolerance, risk capacity, and risk composure.   As an independent income planner, I provide objective, fiduciary-compliant advice so you can make informed decisions in your best interest. My “Red Light on the Dashboard” process is far more powerful than the traditional “second opinion.”  If you’re interested in learning more about securing the cash flow you’ll need to live a retirement you’ll love, see how the “Red Light on the Dashboard”  process will create your worry-free retirement unique to you. https://moneymattersusa.net/red-light  Call 908-791-3831 or 1-800-593-8188.

I well understood our products, our customers and fellow employees.  I learned that we succeed through collaboration and teamwork.  And I learned how to set and accomplish goals through listening, teamwork and respect.  My early career includes territory sales, key account and sales management.  These assignments taught me to listen carefully for customer problems and to respond with solutions.  I lobbied hard for customers within the organization, while learning that our responsibility was solutions - and profitability.  When I moved to operations, I learned that it was imperative to safely improve each day, and that customers demand speed, quality, cost reduction and innovation.  I love working in global organizations which teach that a solid core value culture succeeds worldwide.  Whether in the Americas, Europe or Asia, we build trust, provide value-add, grow relationships and create enormous value.  I earned President (P&L) assignments in multiple business segments such as Energy/Chemical Packaging, Retail, Building Products, Large Mobile Vehicles and Metals.  I recognize that it is impossible to be a product expert in each industry, but that skill sets indeed transfer.  A leader that listens, analyzes and communicates then succeeds.  A leader excels because of his/her individual ability to communicate a vision and strategy; create flexible operating plans; hold high accountability to execution; recognize success.  Integrity is non-negotiable.  Amidst this simple plan, the leader must focus on the team and the individuals.  A leader must be comfortable taking intelligent business risks, but also offering stretch challenges to talented individuals who will be future leaders. ",2,4.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,2019.0,United States

Filling a void in the market for a versatile and stylish water shoe, Fitzgerald created one that she, her friends, and other chic travelers would love to wear. Utilizing her expertise in luxury branding, Fitzgerald’s goal was to create the ultimate resort and summer water sport shoe and lifestyle brand for men, women, and children.  Fitzgerald’s background in luxury goods marketing taught her the importance of a quality product and simplicity of design. After graduating from Duke University and moving to New York City, Fitzgerald joined Hermès and worked as a PR executive for many years, overseeing press relations and the opening of several freestanding stores. After taking time to raise a family, she and her husband founded Greyledge Farm in Litchfield County, CT. Specializing in all-natural, pasture-raised beef, pork, and poultry, the farm served restaurants, specialty shops and individual customers throughout the tri-state area. Though the brands were very different, in both roles she understood the customer wanted a product that is classic, high quality, and beautifully functional.  With an affinity for warm-weather climates, the Fitzgerald family often vacationed at destinations where the beaches were rocky and full of coral. It was here Fitzgerald discovered a white space in the market for a quality, functional water shoe that was attractive enough to also wear to lunch, around town, and boating. At the time, the only water shoe option was the poorly-constructed black mesh variety. Tired of her three teenage sons’ disapproving looks when she wore these “ugly” water shoes, Fitzgerald researched fashionable alternatives and found there were none.  Re-imagining the timeless espadrille design with a quick-drying neoprene upper and non-skid, non-marking deck shoe sole, Fitzgerald developed the Beachcomber Espadrille. Launching Sea Star Beachwear, she returned to the workforce as an entrepreneur, successfully combining her passion for creating and marketing beautiful, quality products and her love of traveling. To date, the company has sold over 100,000 pairs of espadrilles.

I remember giggling while working on a needs assessment – a message that I was meant to do this.  I love learning. I find innovative ways to help people do things better. I have a knack for spotting the desire and potential to improve performance and creating efficient ways to build skills and habits that lead to results. I like pairing theory and practicality to design effective and engaging learning experiences.  In my career, I’ve applied my love of learning to coaching leaders, accelerating organizational change, and building high performing teams – often through digital learning. I enjoy the challenge of new industries so I can discover techniques that work everywhere. •	Digital learning – I started with flip phone videos to help employees make label changes easier. This grew to personalized learning experience platforms, virtual facilitation, social learning, xAPI learning analytics, and content development in eLearning, video, simulation, and all the fun formats. •	Coaching leaders – I’ve developed coaching skills through a Master’s in organizational psychology, courses on positive psychology and appreciative inquiry, and the full curriculum from the Co-Active Training Institute. Nothing thrills me more than supporting people as they learn the craft of leadership.  •	Accelerating organizational change – I have experience leading large transformational change efforts – mixing new technology with behavior change. After years of studying change, I’ve found ways to weave the people side of change into projects. The outcomes have been higher engagement, faster change, and better results. •	Building high performing teams – Working with a diverse group of people is where the magic happens. I know my strengths (and where I’m less good) and look for complementary all-stars to do great work together. My point of view on teams has evolved, but elements I learned as a platoon leader in the U.S. Cavalry still resonate – leader as servant, aligned ambition, and mutual respect.  Outside of work, I learn from my three wonderful daughters, get outside to stay centered, and run often. I am enjoying watching my two oldest daughters run XC without being too involved. As a certified distance running coach, I often bite my lip. I ride the PMC to raise money for cancer research.   I’m still trying to find ways to do it all better.",2,,11.0,,11.0,5.0,2023.0,United States

I was analyst, initial contact, and chief bottle washer when I started CORDA, in 1999. In the beginning, it was a one-person firm with some 50 clients. At least there were no lines in the employee lunchroom. Today, we have a much larger (but still small) dynamic team, over 1,000 clients, and nearly $1 billion in assets under management. I work hard, and so does my team. But I believe it’s vital to get out of the office, no matter how much we love our jobs. That’s why you’ll find me with my family or on my bike on the weekend. Forty- or 50-mile rides are typical, though I’ve pedaled 100 or even 200 miles at a time to benefit fundraisers. I find riding to be a great way to mentally and emotionally refuel. It also keeps me mentally sharp for your Monday-morning phone call.

I now serve as managing editor for Triangle Business Journal in Raleigh. It's a strong local publication with a focus on the business community. Having spent my career in mass media, this has been a great chance to see what drives a niche publication, and how to serve, and grow, a specific audience.  We have had great growth in my time at TBJ — among the best in the American City Business Journals family of 44 business publications. In seven years, we have more than doubled circulation, thanks to a relentless focus on news of high importance to our audience.

Previously, I worked at The News & Observer for 24 years, at WRAL-TV for nearly three and managed the website for WNCN in Raleigh, the NBC affiliate in the market.   In November 2014, WNCN.com was named the top television website in the Carolinas by the news directors association. In my five years there, we went from 500,000 page views a month to 5 million, which had a significant impact on revenue.  I also created a mobile committee at WNCN to get fresh ideas on how to improve there.  It is amazing how the news business has changed in just a few years. That has led to a real clutter of information, but also real opportunities. People will find good information on the web, and they will return for more if the quality remains high.  This time of shifting patterns of consumption means it is more important than ever to be smart about your approach and give consumers information they want. Consumers are establishing new habits and behaviors every day, and smart companies are establishing beachheads now that will lead to further success.  I especially enjoy working with young people with a passion for journalism. I have hired our interns at TBJ and started an intern program at WNCN.

As a result, light pollution from LED-based digital signs takes a toll on the quality of life of nearby urban residents; not everyone wants to live in Las Vegas or Times Square.  This sentiment has led some cities, such as Denver and L.A., to strictly regulate or entirely ban LED displays.

Beyond my ability to develop market leader strategy and create first-of-a-kind deals, I’ve also directly managed business operations and P&L’s to achieve significant growth from innovation.  ANALYZING AND CONTEXTUALIZING MACRO ENVIRONMENTS Early in my career, I witnessed the disruptive forces of Napster at Universal Music Group. Because I wanted a solid analytical framework to lead businesses into the future, I earned my MBA from Wharton before accepting the challenge of thinking through how HBO would navigate the disruption to the home video market. I synthesized these market developments into an actionable plan that would expand the P&L and further enhance the monetization of HBO’s original programming worldwide in various formats. Next, I catalyzed HBO’s digital transformation in a culture where long-standing executives were understandably reluctant to upend the viable core cable business. I built HBO’s first digital business from scratch to nearly $100M in annual global revenue and started the relationships with the likes of Amazon, Apple, Google, and others that are the backbone of HBO’s business today.  STEERING THE BUSINESS INTO THE FUTURE I then joined Oculus (a year after Facebook acquired them) to leverage my entertainment industry relationships and create a strategy to broaden product appeal beyond gamers. At the forefront of VR, I strategized with studios, networks, digital services, and record labels on investing in and embracing the platform. Over the past four years, I’ve led Tastemade’s evolution from a social media company to a lifestyle brand. By building a streaming network and brand extensions, I’ve taken it to a broader media portfolio with a growth trajectory and a more favorable market position with its investors and potential acquirers.

In taking on these time-consuming transaction and intermediary responsibilities, our senior bankers enable their clients to keep focused on a critical component for the successful completion of every transaction – that being the utilization of our clients’ expertise in the day-to-day management of their businesses.  With respect to every transaction, the responsible TrueNorth senior bankers are supported by our full team of bankers. Our team is comprised by professionals who, during the course of the their varied careers, have accumulated the experience and wisdom to become a valuable resource for our deal teams and clients.

We evaluate every policy, every practice, and every dollar spent through a single lens: what is right for students.  We work alongside educators, parents, students, policymakers, and civic and business leaders in communities across the country, providing practical assistance in their efforts to transform schools and colleges into institutions that serve all students well.

We participate actively in national and state policy debates, bringing lessons learned from on-the-ground work and from unflinching data analyses to build the case for policies that will help all students and schools reach high levels of achievement.  Our Core Beliefs: We believe in the power of education to close the gaps that separate low-income students and students of color from other young Americans.   We believe that schools and colleges, appropriately organized, can help virtually all students master the knowledge they need to succeed.    We believe long-standing gaps in opportunity, achievement, and attainment have roots inside and outside of schools. And though we know these gaps are stubborn, we also know they are not inevitable.

From power-tools to pharmaceuticals, motorbikes to exports of agricultural produce, the family business was diverse. Naturally, I caught the bug for running and growing businesses, so off I went to study management and finance. The focus has always been about developing the right strategy to address the end-customer’s needs. This has been the constant theme for the last 20+ years.   In 2001, I joined Mechtronix Inc., a true start-up, born out of the engineering labs of Concordia University. It had developed a disruptive technological solution for flight training simulators. Within a few years, I joined the business’ leadership team and helped drive CAGR at +30%.  As VP Business Operations I helped further position Mechtronix as an influential player in the flight simulation industry. After the 2009/2010 financial crisis, I was a key member of the team that led the company’s restructuring, positioning it for further profitable growth.   Later on, I was instrumental in selling Mechtronix to Textron Inc., a strategic buyer who as an aircraft OEM, wanted to enter the flight training simulation market. I also led the negotiation with Textron’s Strategy and M&A team within a 9-month due-diligence process.   Textron’s CEO and Chairman asked me to lead the new business’ (TRU Simulation + Training) commercial airliner P&L as GM & VP Air Transport Simulation. Within TRU Air Transport I oversaw the business’ P&L, including engineering, operations, program management, deliveries, customer service and sales. Some highlights were:   •	Defining the 5-year growth strategy that resulted in the increase of annual revenue 4x, from CDN $40MM to $160MM. •	Capturing US $600MM of new business, including two 10-year exclusive agreements with Boeing for the development of the Flight simulators for the 737Max and the 777-x and a new preferred supplier agreement with Airbus. •	Quintupling (5x) production capacity and setting-up of a customization & delivery center to support customer configuration for a larger throughput. •	Scaling the organization and building effective teams to support the aggressive growth of the business. The overall workforce more than doubled from 150 to just under 400 employees.  Looking forward, I want to leverage this experience to help other businesses grow and establish themselves as key players in their respective markets. This involves putting together the right team to leverage a disruptive technology / business model for the purpose of achieving profitable growth.

Come in our store and try on, get fitted, compare and contrast, touch and feel our product and interact with staff who know and go outdoors.  Our 9 convenient shops are filled with gear and clothing for life outside; work and play. We can help you get where you are going, outfit you for comfort, safety, and help you engage in sport outdoors. We expect the product we sell you to satisfy. We guarantee that it will.  GETTING OUT As a LOCAL OUTFITTER, we know how important it is to demo and test the gear. You might as well break a sweat before you purchase, like cutting a cord of wood before you purchase the chainsaw.  Great Outdoor Provision Co. is committed to providing opportunities to paddle, cast, tread, feel and taste the products we sell. We offer paddling sessions,  boat demos & fishing classes in the field and on the water. See our event calendar for more info.  GIVING BACK We give back to outdoor cornerstones that have marked our lives. For example, we chose local land trusts because they acquire land for protection thus preserving open space for adventure. Scout Troops provide the leadership and skills that enable young people to safely enjoy the wilderness. Habitat For Humanity works to provide affordable housing for families in need. We recognize that you make these contributions possible by shopping our stores so we thank you.",1522.0,"I am so grateful my parents took me camping as a youngster - that introduction to adventure left an indelible mark.  As a teenager I joined my sister, a park ranger, in Yellowstone National Park where I worked through college summers.  The importance of family/community and the natural world continues to guide my life today. Great Outdoor Provision Co. has been that extended family for over 35 years and provides a community to share the magic of wilderness adventure.  I am indebted to the many who have tossed me a fly rod, a paddle, a map and encouraged me to hit the trail.  Our customers keep me inspired.  As a company we work alongside our customers and local grassroots organizations to give back to the places we love.  As founder of  Land Trust Day, we support open space throughout North Carolina and Virginia to assure that the next generation has wild places to discover.  And as an outfitter, we enjoy the best of gear to use when accessing these beautiful resources and it gives us joy to share that knowledge with those we serve every day.    In addition to hundreds of blisters we've helped to raise over $100,000 to specifically build, protect and promote North Carolina's State Trail - The Mountains to Sea Trail.  The MST is now celebrating 45 years and provides wilderness experiences to thousands every year.  We are proud to be a Unity Blaze partner.  The Unity Blaze is the campfire symbol in the center of Black Folks Camp Too! logo and it means treat everyone, everywhere, equally. Your race, age or gender does not matter. We all have something to say around the proverbial campfire.

Although I am grateful for the excellent clinical care that my daughter has received, I have realized that her connection to animals has been instrumental to her well-being. The healing power of human-animal interaction has truly saved my daughter’s life.   My professional and personal experiences have inspired me to help found a nonprofit that is dedicated to improving teen mental wellness. In my role as Executive Director at the Chris Center, Inc., I am leveraging my clinical expertise, business intelligence, and advocacy skills to provide an innovative wellness resource to adolescents in my community. The Chris Center's programs offer teens and pre-teensan opportunity to interact with animals, explore nature, connect to peers, and join a supportive community. I am committed to empowering teens to live more peaceful and healthier lives, and I am beyond grateful to be involved in this exciting new venture.",2,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2024.0,United States

Normally a company would only operate in stealth mode for the first couple of years. As investors may have to disclose funding a stealth startup, their names are made public, but often only a general summary description is known about the company.

With a passion for innovation and organization optimization, I have spent the last 8 years managing robotics ventures, drawing from my background in mechatronics and honing my project and product management capabilities along the way. I've held both CEO and CTO positions in green tech and deep tech (robotics, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning) companies, and my unique perspective as an executive and inventor makes me particularly adept at strategy, business development, positioning, and determining product-market fit. Among the several award-winning products I have developed are thermoelectric technologies, medical devices for patient compliance, food preparation robots, and most notably, an intelligent robotic arm for manufacturing. I developed my organizational and communication skill set leading cross-functional teams of more than 25 PhD and MA engineers, raising over $6M in venture funding, and negotiating over $13M in contracts.  What drew me to robotics was its potential to improve the human condition. My true passion and purpose is innovating technologies that revolutionize industries and improve people’s lives, and I have a great deal of experience delivering on complex projects throughout all stages of the product life cycle. My work developing electro-mechanical systems and spearheading the design of a next-gen robot and collaborative robotic arm for food preparation as Technical Director and Hardware Engineer at Chowbotics helped increase the availability of fresh food options in food deserts across the world. Before that, I mastered early stage product development while sharpening my leadership style as CTO and Co-Founder of Carbon Robotics. In my most robust entrepreneurial venture to date, I built our business from the ground up while leading a team of engineers and helmed projects spanning the full robotics stack from silicon to mechatronics to cloud.

I was drawn to Competency Management after witnessing too many business changes based on  ad-hoc, “intuitive” decisions. For most, the outcomes were disappointing. Even when results were successful, the organizations didn’t know why the changes worked -- leaving leaders equally vulnerable to mysterious failures. I have found that corporations and government organizations that make business decisions based on data -- in this case, on data about workforce skills and competencies --  make better decisions and achieve predictable, repeatable success.   I co-founded Avilar, a leading competency management and eLearning solutions company, to deliver software that does just that — turning proven strategies, processes and best practices into a flexible software solution.  Over the years we’ve helped organizations increase profitability, improve workforce allocation and enhance productivity. Recently, we: •	Created a system to gauge the proficiency of a large Department of Defense (DoD) organization to determine if they are meeting mission requirements. •	Developed a system to align budgeted positions with actual capabilities for a large military organization. •	Helped an international organization place people in worldwide locations to meet rotating assignments. •	Optimized the training for a large bank to make sure employees are meeting strategic goals. •	Helped a large healthcare insurance company meet both training and career goals for their employees. •	Created a system to help hospitals maintain accreditation by meeting workforce compliance goals.

Our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world, which affects the freedom of people in general.

So we will make an evolutionary development in the Creator economy to the Community Creator economy.  Clubs grew out of my previous business, the Yodvisor platform. Yodvisor was designed to bring together business mentors and entrepreneurs who need the experience and knowledge of other stronger business people. During the pandemic, we made a pivot, as most of our clients stopped using the services. So we began to apply our accumulated experience - creating communities and managing communities.

(Stop with the evil questions! üòà üòá)  I ask these because first impressions matter in business, and often, your website is the first interaction customers will have with you. Will it be GOOD or BAD? üòà  I build websites, and my two aims are: 1) be better than competitors and 2) be discoverable in search.  #1 You must rid of the bad first impression.  We've all experienced the horrors of making a bad first impression (potential date, job interview, public speaking, .etc). It's a dreadful feeling, but even worse, it typically means not getting the opportunity we want.   Your website plays a major role in making a good or bad first impression of you. When potential customers and even referrals land on your website and get confused by the text or find the design not modern or just hard to navigate, they lose confidence in reaching out to you.    The naughty of bad websites: ‚ùå Potential customers lose trust in your abilities versus your competition. ‚ùå Unclear design, confusing (non-punchy) text, and slow-loading websites sway people away.  #2 Leverage your website to be your 24/7 marketing tool that stands above competitors.  On the contrary, a good website can be the secret sauce to good first impressions. Think about it...how many times have you looked at a competitor's website, felt envious, and wished that your website could look like theirs?  We all have, but I believe that if your website shows that you can solve customer problems, that you are genuinely ""enjoyable"" to work with, and is enjoyable to browse because your design and copy are relevant and slick, potential customers will be more willing to reach out.   The secret sauce of good websites: ‚úÖ Customers love to work with those who seem relatable, knowledgeable, and inspiring. ‚úÖ Great design, word clarity, and being discoverable via search engines make you appear as the traits mentioned above and ultimately stand above your competition.  This is the website superpower and a marketing tool that can work for you 24/7.  If you're looking to build a new website, I'd love to learn more. Let's design your good first impression because it's absolute power!  I'm Mike, and I've been designing websites for over a decade, making 200+ websites for businesses and educators. I have also taught web design and marketing to thousands of students worldwide.   More about me here: https://www.webodew.com/about  Stand out. Be found.

What is Artificial Intelligence?  Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn. It is also a field of study which tries to make computers ""smart""‚Äã. In general use, the term ""artificial intelligence""‚Äã means a machine which mimics human cognition. At least some of the things we associate with other minds, such as learning and problem solving can be done by computers, though not in the same way as we do. Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein define AI as a system‚Äôs ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.  What can an AI digital therapist do?  An AI digital therapist can learn to mimic natural conversation patterns of the mental health professional that created it. This technique is referred to as scripting. Through scripting an AI can be trained to provide general counselling to individuals who suffer from mental health issues 24/7 anywhere around the world. The AI also has built in superpowers such as linguistic and sentiment analysis that allows the machine to automatically uncover important personality insights about the user. These insights can be used for providing more effective therapy. The AI can also be trained to talk through text or simulate voice conversations with the user.

That's where I come in.   Hi! i'm Britt Frank, licensed neuropsychotherapist, personal leadership expert, and author of The Science of Stuck and The Getting Unstuck Workbook (Penguin Random House).  The Shiny Professional Info: I received my BA from Duke University and my MSW from The University of Kansas, where I later became an award-winning adjunct professor. My work has been featured in Forbes, Esquire, The New York Times,  NPR, New York Magazine, Fast Company, SHRM, and Psychology Today.   The Sordid Personal Info: Behind the curtain of my seemingly normal life, I struggled for more than two decades with addiction and anxiety, fully convinced that change was for other people, not for me. When I learned what I now teach, everything changed.  Why This Matters: Personal leadership and peak performance require more than mindset- I teach the simple science of big results.  You DON'T need motivation to overcome procrastination.  You DON'T need to know ""why"" you're stuck to get unstuck.  You DON‚ÄôT need to dive into feelings or empathy to be an effective and human-centered leader.  I deliver actionable, science-backed strategies so you can get yourself and your team back into the driver's seat of life.   What You Get During a Keynote: An entertaining and fast-paced ride filled with fluff-free, practical tools grounded in neuroscience. Everyone knows what it's like to get stuck. And the way forward is simpler than you'd think.  What does LSCSW, SEP mean? LSCSW means I am licensed to practice psychotherapy. SEP means I completed a 3 year post-graduate neuroscience-based training program. Shocking fact-- many psychotherapists are NOT required to learn anything about the brain in graduate school. Strange but true.   When our brains BRAIN better, life gets better. Learn more at www.scienceofstuck.com",2,11.0,2.0,11.0,2.0,,2013.0,United States

This perfectly matches his ‚Äúthinking slow‚Äù (strategic, analytical ‚Ä¶) and ‚Äúacting fast‚Äù (decisive, hands-on) personality. This makes it possible to combine a long-term outlook and perseverance to achieve goals and outwork others (both people and companies).    As an ""Architect"" (INTJ) is one of the rarest and most strategically capable personality types (only 2% of the population). INTJ personality types are imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, amazingly curious individuals, but they do not squander their energy.   This has provided a multitude of interesting professional experiences: from helping startups with their MVP, or product management processes, to being part of a sounding, advisory board, or board of directors, to grow startups to multinational, multimillion revenue companies (from a product manager, bot as individual contributor and functional team responsible).   From a personal view-point, the strategic mindset and the will to achieve unique milestones, has made him great in time management and combining a plethora of high value projects and challenges, including both in the private as research sector. All of this hard work, has made it possible to achieve some nice dreams and stability on the life side of the work life balance spectrum. Although Fr√©d√©ric is a strong believer in working hard, doing what you love, high energy, high velocity is possible without having the feeling of a possible looming burnout if you believe in the value of your work, to you, the family and society.   As a founder of Aquila Ventures made me experience the value of helping out startups, and share their highs and lows. The opportunity to found NOWJOBS as product manager with 4 people and nothing but a vision, has made Fr√©d√©ric aware of his impressive analytical, data-driven problem-solving skills, finding innovative and automation solutions for some of the hardest legal and financial challenges in the industry. Driving the strategic product vision, while experiencing the intense growth of NOWJOBS as a company (4 countries, 100 people, 100 million in revenue and a first acquisition) solidified his confidence in product management.   The passion for startups, combined with confidence in his product management skills, has now set the stage for his next big challenge, earning his doctorate in the field of requirements engineering with a focus on software startups. This has a tremendous societal value. Enjoy the ride, enjoy the highs as much as you need to enjoy conquering the lows.",2,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,9.0,2016.0,Belgium

The truth about why I‚Äôm so passionate about blockchain?  I heard about Bitcoin several times during my period as a computer science undergrad.  It sounded good but I didn't really pay attention until I started a cybersecurity consulting career.   I must confress, I was initially drawn to the ideas behind public key cryptography, hashes and other geekery.  However, my eyes opened once I started to hear people were making millions with this thing that operates with the same technology, I had now become so familiar with.  So, what was my move?  I soon realized Bitcoin was just the tip of the iceberg. At some point I decided to go all in and jumped into this odyssey called blockchain.  I can not deny it, I also wanted to make a fortune, the same way you probably do. I started in blockchain to make a fortune, but that‚Äôs not the reason I decided to stay.  I now believe that blockchain is the industry that gives you and me the ability to empower humanity with technology, and we can go beyond mere wealth creation.  We now have the power to forge unprecedented opportunities around the globe, we can create value with sheer determination, ambition and a laptop. We can write history with code.

During that time, I was able to gain experience providing direct management and/or oversight for multiple core business areas including, sales and marketing, business development, accounting, human resources, information technology, services, proposal management, legal, security, and research and development.     In 2009, I decided to follow my passion for software, and launched my second business, 5000fish, Inc.  Our flagship product, Yurbi (www.yurbi.com), is an affordable dashboard and reporting software for growing businesses and partners who are looking to embed and white label advanced analytics into their products and services.    As a bootstrapped entrepreneur, I was able to leverage the success of OakTree Solutions to build a powerful enterprise software application that competes head to head with industry giants that are either publically traded or have raised 100s of millions of VC funding.  While my primary focus is on the growth and development of Yurbi, my passion to help other entrepreneurs lead to the creation of the Tech Smart Boss brand in 2017.  Via our weekly podcast (soundcloud.com/techsmartboss), newsletter (newsletter.techsmartboss.com) and YouTube channel (youtube.com/c/techsmartboss), I provide actionable business advice on how to align business process and technology to grow your business with a bootstrapped, lean operations approach.

The four share not only their time by the Bay at the United States Naval Academy, but also a love of fine sports coats, skipping practice parades, and spending time with friends in Downtown Annapolis at Acme, McGarveys or Dillos.   After graduation, as is tradition, all four friends swore to never return to the Yard and PCS‚Äôd to distant parts of the world serving in various positions and posts in the Navy and the Marine Corps, but always keeping in touch and united by their original Jacket Club. After spending four years apart, the original Jacket Club members reunited in San Diego, California. While helping one of the Jacket Club members move houses, the four reminisced on their time at USNA when they found an old ‚ÄúBlue Magnet‚Äù. They realized that although they spent all four years at USNA trying to escape the absurdity of midshipmen life, one thing that they did enjoy at the Academy was catching a nice post noon-meal formation nap, either in or on, the beloved ‚ÄúBlue Magnet‚Äù.   Enter, The Jacket Club.  In order to commemorate the time shared by the Bay, these four friends thought what better way to combine their love of jackets and time shared in The Hall than have an actual piece of the Academy to wear. The Goat Jacket is hand crafted and designed to incorporate a piece of the Naval Academy that we hope present and past midshipmen like us can now wear anywhere around the world from downtown Annapolis to Yokosuka, Japan.  Whether it is on the field at the Navy and Marine Corps Stadium, on the Wesley Brown Track, in the Hall, in Nimitz trying to pass Calculus II, or your Firstie-year Dirt presentation on invading France, we encourage you to find your club that will last a lifetime.

I am excited by the idea of crossing unconventional borders and setting new precedents. I believe in the beauty of precision, the power of hard work, and the necessity of completion. I place a premium on excellent UX and spend my time thinking and creating at the intersection of AI and impactful problem areas.  My work currently revolves around Yuva AI, where I've developed a software platform that develops computer vision AI systems more efficiently and ethically with simulated images and videos. The tool can generate data for all industries and I‚Äôve created the world's first truly representative synthetic human generator for computer vision AI. The framework and tool I developed has been adopted by companies developing AI worth $1B+ annually. These include Fortune 500s and blue-chip venture-backed firms across Europe, North America and APAC.  I believe AI has the potential to help us realise our shared dream of a better future for all of humanity if developed with inclusivity and ethics at its core. As noted in Stanford‚Äôs 100AI report released in September ‚Äò21, AI has made a major leap from the lab to people‚Äôs lives in recent years, which increases the urgency to understand its potential negative effects - a few of which we have already seen materialise in deaths from self driving cars and wrongful incarcerations due to biased facial recognition. I believe that what we do now to understand, guide and develop human-centered AI is setting up the future of generations to come. That reality motivates me. Being privileged to have witnessed first-hand the failures of cutting-edge AI as a teenager, I believe it is more important than ever to build the table for conversations where they need to be happening. While I‚Äôve begun addressing this problem at a technical level with synthetic data, what I‚Äôve realised is that this problem is bigger than a simple software fix. AI will affect every aspect of our lives and our civilization, from social bonds and ethics to the economy and healthcare, education and government.

At The Second Shift, Jenny spearheads community growth, cultivating a network of thousands of expert women and curating events across the country to bring members and business partners together to discuss how to optimize the personal and professional success of working women with a focus on their mental, emotional and spiritual wellness.

We're 5-people strong and we're full steam ahead on building during this bear market. What a time to be alive!  I've been fortunate enough to pull from my experiences from my time as the first engineer at Lumos, an a16z-funded startup on a mission to amplify every person's and every organization's security, collaboration, and productivity! Needless to say, the journey to grow a startup from the ground-up has been incredibly stimulating and fulfilling.  On top of that, my experience as a software engineer on the Azure Kubernetes Service team (AKS) and on the Azure Blockchain team building enterprise-grade blockchain services has given me the skills and tools I need to build scalable and extensible software.  ---- It's hard to define where I'm from, but growing up in the US, Singapore, Japan, and the UK has shaped me into a multicultural individual, passionate to bridge different cultures together.  I find learning about other people's cultures truly fascinating. I love traveling and learning the local language and the way of life. However in our hectic lives, it's often difficult to drop what we're doing and live in another country; we don't even leave time to go out of our way to meet different people living in the same community.  From personal experience, I believe working together on the same team with someone from a different culture can accelerate this learning process. While peoples' beliefs and cultures may be different, I find that many times we share common values and aspirations. My vision is to use technology to allow people from different backgrounds to find and work with each other towards a common goal, which I believe will eliminate cultural barriers and facilitate our understanding of other cultures.  Interesting (and random) idea - wouldn't it be cool if you can see pictures/videos about some topic when someone is talking? A lot of times people can't relate to each other because they just don't share the same background or are imagining different things as they listen. If you can share that emotional factor somehow, both parties could come to a mutual understanding faster. Many ways to share ""emotions"" via technology but photos/videos might be an interesting start!  Shoot me a message if you want to talk!

No focus on salability 5. Winging the process  We also know that owners don't have spare time to waste - so we've made the plan easy to implement and extremely practical.

It could be that their exit price is way less than expected or the sale doesn‚Äôt even happen.   After decades of deals, I saw that failed exits mostly occur for one or more of these 5 reasons:  1. Little advanced planning 2. Unrealistic goals 3. Theoretical valuations 4. No focus on salability 5. Winging the process   I knew if these 5 problems could be addressed head on it would guarantee a successful exit for the greatest value.   When I tell owners about the 5 problems, they understand. They also realize that the sale of their business is the most important deal they‚Äôll ever do.   But, they tell me there are two more immediate issues: They don‚Äôt know how to get started with exit planning and they have no time to spare.   So I created The Cash Out Plan, a sale planning and advisory service.   It addresses both: a) the 5 reasons exits fail and b) the need for a practical process that time constrained owners can use for a successful exit.   The Cash Out Plan helps business owners:   üëâ Create an exit plan using a practical, time efficient system  üëâ Understand the key steps to reach aggressive value and timing goals  üëâ Determine valuation based on real buyer feedback, not theory  üëâ Fix business issues that could blow up their deal  üëâ Use a tight process to position and market their business, closing with the buyer that pays the most    The Cash Out Plan is based on my 30 years of experience helping business owners realize their financial dreams.

Our mission is to lower costs in the laboratory industry and reduce biohazard waste in the environment by delivering groundbreaking approaches in dealing with plastic consumables.
